0	5	this is great!  cant tell the difference from original peanut better.  I have it with my fruit or on toast. Compared to the origanal calories of 45 vs 190 per serving..can't beat it.  Love this and will keep buying it.
1	2	this ia a good idea; however, difficult to open.  must squeeze/twist pretty hard & product oozes free - usually all over fingers.  also, portion size is a bit too small.  still love agave.
2	4	The texture and flavor are good. They are very filling. These are better than any Slim Fast bar even though the calories are high (290). There's no after taste and no unpset stomach. The are a perfect item for a quick breakfast and should be kept in every desk drawer incase a realxing lunch is not available. These bars are better than anything in a crappy snack machine.
3	5	This bar has the best texture and stays moist almost like a bakery item.  The nits off set the texture so that it is not too mushy making it a wonderful combination.  The calorie content isn't discouraging either making it a good buy for the whole family to enjoy.
4	5	I use Sempio whenever I can get it. &#65279; Soy sauce, kim, sweet potato noodles ... many more but one of my favorites is youndoo. I love to make muk but I like to add just a little flavor to the jelly in addition to the sauce. When I'm heating the mung bean powder and water, besides salt, I add a little sesame oil and Youndoo. My muk is so delicious with the Youndoo!
5	5	This is real earth friendy food that is good for health and preserves the species of good salmon just like the Native Indians did. Respect, Wisdome and Honer
6	5	I hope I don't offend but I am not a regular visitor to Starbucks.  It is not because I don't like them but it is because I usually have my coffee at home.  Their product is actually pretty good from the few times I have been to one of their stores.  This product ranks high on my list of prepackaged coffees.  Light as I like it, but very flavorful, it is a nice way to start the day.  Don't shy away from it because it has a "chain restaurant" brand, it is actually pretty good.
7	4	Taste great. They are pretty small so I need at least two on my 2+ hour bike rides. A noticeable pick me up.
8	5	Can't find these in the grocery store any more, so please keep them here on Amazon! Great snack!!  I Love them!!!
9	5	These are really good chocolate oat bars, and although I know the price changes, the unit price I paid for them were pretty close to the unit price at Wal-Mart. You get 12 boxes of 5 for a total of 60 bar which is a lot. But I highly recommend them as daily snacks or even breakfast plus they're high in fiber with their being 9g per bar. There are different flavors, but Oats and Chocolate is usually the cheapest. Overall, the bars are tasty, healthy, and great for snacks. I highly recommend.
10	5	I had been purchasing this product in the 11 oz size from Whole Foods. Because it is one of the only sweeteners I use, I use it up regularly.  Some people reviewed that they were disappointed with the size when the received their shipment...well, to them I'd say "read carefully and understand about measurements". It was a good purchase for me, as I've refilled my other 11 oz bottle 3 times plus I purchased it with another item that qualified for free shipping. I will be purchasing this again.
11	5	<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K8ESAU">Necta Sweet Sugar Substitute Tablets, 1/2 Grain, 500-Count Bottle (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />If you don't like the powder mess of packages, this is the way to go. You might want to get the 1/4 grain, as these might be too sweet for some people. All the local grocery stores have stopped carrying this product, so it was great to find it on Amazon. It does give you about a 3-year supply however!
12	4	It is what it is. Does what it should. Could be better but it also could be more expensive. All in all, I'm happy.
13	4	Ten Ren has different grades of oolong tea, but for me since I drink oolong tea a lot, I purchased this since this was very affordable.<br />The grade is of course not high, but for everyday use, this is great.
14	1	I wanted to avoid using food coloring due to it containing the ingredient red 40. So I used this powder to color my cake red well it did not work. The color of the red velvet cake was light brown; this powder does not work for cakes.
15	5	I absolutely love these centipedes!! Wish I could have gotten a smaller version of this bag cause I can't stop eating them..Delicious
16	5	This coconut oil is very good quality and half a price cheaper than in Whole Foods. Smells great, like coconuts of course, and it's very useful not only in kitchen but also in in my beauty regime (hair and skin).
17	3	I was a bit concerned as the jerky had an odd odor not present in canine caviar products I had bought before, but they looked fine and my dog enjoyed them, so maybe it was just because they had been packed in an airtight package for shipping.  This product is WAY too expensive, but my dog really enjoys it.
18	3	I was quite disappointed in the flat taste of this product. There was a lot of meat, however, but the sauce and potatoes seemed to be rather lackluster in appearance and taste. I finally mixed 2 packages with some brown gravy, added a bit of blended seasoning and brought it to life. I would not buy this product again.
19	5	I was really reluctant to give these treats to my cat. It's really important to me that she eats a very healthy diet, and while I'm not doing the raw food diet, I do scrutinize labels for meat by-products, BHA, and useless fillers. With that said, my cat couldn't care less for those "healthy" treats that had passed my inspection. I have a cupboard full of treats I felt comfortable giving her that she ended up saving so she could play with them later. So, out of desperation, I bought these; a treat is, after all, a treat. And she goes berserk over them. She's runs to the kitchen whenever I simply open a cupboard, hoping I'm about to give her one of her precious treats. I've also finally taught her to Come on command! And, to be honest, other treats (including this brand's regular treats) have a lot worse ingredients.
20	1	I was excited to get some "jerky like you get at trade shows" this was the worst jerky my family has ever had,inedible,salt lick.<br />Jerky normally is gone in minutes this was gone all right out to the  garbage ,I was very disappointed
21	4	My cat is used to eating Weruva and Tiki Cat, so I wasn't sure how he would take to this brand. This doesn't look at all like the previous two brands (which actually look like people food) whereas BFF brand looks like typical cat food. Lou isn't normally picky, but he doesn't eat this food quite as quickly as Tiki or Weruva. I bought two cases of 10 (Tuna & Bonito and Tuna & Shrimp) and while it's a good price, I think next time we'll stick to Weruva for big cans of food and Tiki for small cans (he gets one big can in the am and one small can in the pm!) I'd buy this stuff again in the future if I was in a pinch, as it's not a bad food...I just like my cats food to look more like real fish or chicken vs over processed "stuff". But good ingredients and grain free at a good price!
22	1	This product does not work.  We know we have a clothing moth problem.  We frequently kill the flying adults and vacuum the rugs, carpets, and other areas where the eggs are laid, but they are still not completely eradicated.  However, NONE of the traps ever contained anything.
23	5	We have been drinking CC for over 50 years - the smooth taste is unbeatable!<br />I ordered the Between Roast to make sure the coffee was not expired, or about to.  Expiration date was almost a year from purchase date - I am ordering the Dark Roast today. (I like to mix the two - something my mother taught me years ago)
24	5	This is the best commercially available beef jerky around. It's drier than most products out there (Pemican, Jack Daniels) and much more authentic. Sadly, it seems that Trader Joe's has stopped carying it and started using their own, inferior brand. Honestly, it'g going to reduce the number of trips I make to trader joe's by 1/2. Anyway, if you like authentic beef jerkey (like the kind you used to find in the glass jars at gas stations) this is the only brand for you!
25	4	This is a great coffee....I have been tasting many different brands....this one is rich, bold, and delicious!<br /><br />I highly recommend this coffee, it's a nice get up and go blend.
26	5	Foremost: ~99% soluble fiber is great for you.<br /><br />These noodles will-not get soft. I would not recommend for marinara sauce of any type. These noodles are made for stir fry type dishes. I did not feel they were rubbery at all. Make sure you blanch (toss in boiling water for a few minutes) before eating them.<br /><br />Overall, just ordered more. Taste? There is none to the noodles themselves; though they don't smell nicely right out of the bag ( you are supposed to rinse then blanch).<br /><br />Anyone who has the need to be 'full' and wants to 'diet' or just wants more fiber in your diet easily... GET THESE!
27	4	Good price. All my cats love it, and I think it'd pretty healthy. I have four cats , and I feed five feral cats. I can't buy very expensive food.<br />They all like this.
28	5	If you think that salt is merely salt, listen up! This salt gives a flavor to food that you<br />would have never imagined. Salt is a flavor enhancer, but this salt tastes like the Rolls<br />Royce of them all. If you want to savor your cooking and kick it up a notch or two, I recommend<br />sprinkling this salt on just about anything you can put in your mouth. BRAVO!
29	5	These pancakes are delicious.  My son loves them. NO dairy, egg, gluten, soy... and they still taste great.
30	5	Okay, I know this is probably like a little kids/baby product, but I can't help it-- I'm hooked on these things. I'm a graduate student in college, and I buy these by the case to have as breakfast-on-the-go while driving to school, or snacks in the evening. Of course, they're so small I have to eat like three at a time to be satisfied-- this is why buying by the case is great-- but it ends up being really expensive because they're so small. So yeah, if they go on sale, buy lots of them. They're great.
31	5	I used this product many years ago and liked the results.  Recently I decided to use it for a dinner I was preparing for guests.  Unfortunately I tried all our grocery stores (6) and none of them had this Knorr product.  I was so please to find that I could get it at Amazon.  My sauerbraten dinner was a success!
32	5	These are exactly what I was looking for, but can't find in my local marketing area.  Instead of a two hour round trip, I sat at my computer, and they came right to my door in short order.  I will be ordering more when these run out.
33	5	My girlfriend and I prefer Lavazza over anything. We prefer the crema that Lavazza seems to produce better than other brands. This Creme e Gusto is superb (for a pre-ground). We always prefer to grind our own beans but we like to have a backup that is pre-ground for company so we can quickly make espressos without a lot of waiting between cups. We've tried several Lavazza pre-ground and all are pleasing, this is no exception. you aren't taking any chances here, except for a slightly higher-than-prefered price.
34	5	These are great for traveling, camping, those cold mornings when you've forgotten to get the coffee maker ready the night before or when your late and don't have time.  It's a very deep flavor which I think is great, especially with a little creamer...it really has that starbucks latte flavor.  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!  AND GREAT PRICE compared to the store!  We keep the decaf kind on hand too for evenings on the deck...can't say enough about it!  AWESOME!
35	5	Excellent Wholesome Sweetners Organic Raw blue Agave- would like to purchase by the gallon rather than 23.5 0z bottles of 6 however.
36	5	I have a 5 lb Maltese who eats more like a cat. He eats until he is full and walks away. Dry food is best, I am told but it so.... "dry". I don't want to give him human food because I'm told I shouldn't - but also because he eats so little, I want to be sure he's healthy. My solution has been to buy Cesar by the case from Amazon (auto shipment) and mix it with his dry. I buy dry food for small adult dogs, mix a scoop (1 cup?) with 1/4-1/3 container of Cesar. I mix it with a for or my hands (so he doesn't just eat the Cesar and walk away). He gets the benefit of dry food for his teeth etc and the tastiness of Cesar's wonderful flavors.
37	5	There's nothing like coming in to hot cider on a cold day - and it's sure been cold where I am lately! Flavorful, always on hand, won't turn to vinegar in the box - what else could you ask for?
38	5	This is such a delicious bag of Peppered Beef Jerky. I love having a big bag of it to snack on whenever I feel like it. What a great product!!
39	5	Very good taste and texture. So yummy on the lot a dots cake. Very delicious. and very easy to make. Love them both!
40	1	I purchased this beautiful waiters corkscrew a few years ago. I used it perhaps once a month. It fell apart, the metal strip in between the two pieces of olive wood broke.  I contacted Laguiole directly, I no longer had the receipt. Their very curt reply was that the only warranty was through wherever I had purchased it. They would not even allow me to ship it to them to look at.  I have purchased many things in my life, and when something breaks after a month or two, it has always been the manufacturer I have had to deal with.<br />With a company manufacturing and selling such supposed quality items as these, they should work with customers that have had one fall apart. I was told they would not accept it if I mailed it to them. They claim to have a lifetime warranty, but won't accept me sending them back a broken item? Fine, there are other top quality manufactures I will use for top quality corkscrews, cutlery and other such items. I'm done with Laguiole, its not acceptable at this price.
41	3	I liked the idea of the mix by the nut company. However, the mix had 70% raisins with some dried cherries, a few walnuts, and miscellanous other nuts. I liked it, but it was not what I thought I was buying. I won't be buying it again.
42	4	Dear Sir's,<br />  this tea has the lift the others do not. Soft feeling in the leaves of this tea holding the package with the smell<br />  Yungas.Just put the open bag under your nose close enough. And one will know they have a quility tea.<br />  Great hot and or cold.Actualty a organic stimulant now with heal properties as well.Different from the other's.<br />  Fair price.<br /><br />  David
43	4	Great product.  It tastes fairly good and does give you a nice burst of energy to do what you need to do on a Wednesday (and Thursday)
44	1	Bought a house where the yard has been neglect for 6-10yrs. The weeds dominate the back yard and it's not your typical dandilion. These are the tough ones with the thicker stems. Trying to save money and hard labor I bought two of these, more then required for the area I was testing them on and soaked it down. Took quite a bit of time but I thought for sure it would work. Unfortunately not a change. I can't give a review for people dealing with regular weeds they get in their lawn but if you barely have a lawn because of weeds then this will not work for you. Sorry to say that.
45	3	The wasabi flavor was not as strong as I like. I have had others (in the large 39 ounce plastic jar from Costco that were better, but they are no longer available.  These are an adequate substitute.  The smaller container is handy.<br /><br />PK
46	5	Not sure why only one store in my shopping area carries this cereal as it is awesome. I love it and so does my body. I try and eat it every day and hubby likes to top his other cereal with it as well. Forgot to pick it up at the only store where it is available at today, so tried to make homemade granola--near total flop. I think I will be making a trip into town to get some more boxes. I'm glad amazon carries it in case I can't buy it, but why doen't other stores carry it?
47	4	Silk Very Vanilla Soy Milk is yummy and consistently good, with each case I purchase. Buying the 8 oz containers of shelf stable soy milk by the case means that it costs a lot less than buying it at my local health food store. My only objection to this product is that the straws are really narrow. So a big hint to all the Very Vanilla Soy Milk fans out there - buy a box of wide straws and use those to drink from the container. Somehow it tastes even yummier like that.<br />Also, it this product can be used to make Chocolate Egg Creams.  In a tall glass put about 1/2 inch of chocolate syrup and about a third of an inch of Very vanilla on top of that.  Stir together with a long, large straw until well blended.  Slowly pour in a seltzer from a freshly opened bottle of seltzer. Yum.
48	5	I have been a Stash Tea fan for years.  The price on Amazon Grocery is terrific, and yes, you will drink your chai every day throughout the winter!  Try the regular or decaf chai with a tablespoon or two of real cream--it's the perfect drink for those chilly days.
49	5	This is by far the greatest chocolate sauce I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing and is the only chocolate sauce I will enjoy the rest of my life!!!  It has become a regular gift I give to friends and family and they all agree that it is the ultimate chocolate sauce. Their Caramel and Espresso sauce are also amazing products and I highly recommend trying them all.
50	3	Sorry to say I'm thinking maybe they came up with the name because it sounded yummy and attractive.  I couldn't taste any respberry, peach or Champagne.  It was simply a melange of the indistinguishable.<br /><br />  It was given a 3 because it did spread easily, the color is pretty and it moistened toast.  Others at the table felt the same way  - not at all sure what we were eating.  It was quite sweet, which didn't particularly encourage me because I was looking for a "fruity" flavor - maybe raspberry,  maybe peach?<br /><br />  A disappointment.
51	5	This is my favorite. It is the k-cup hot tea with the most flavor. Highly recommend. I sweeten with splenda.
52	1	I was very disappointed...i received this product and all but one was damaged..there is no returns on this..so i would not recommend to buy this
53	5	If you enjoy  drinking tea in the morning or most any time during the day, this product is very good.  I recommend it highly.
54	1	I was very disapointed that it states only 2 ingredients and find to my dismay it also contains salt and oils.<br />Mislead or misread of advertisement. Boo to these snacks!
55	3	...how come Amazon stopped selling it under Amazon Prime? I once bought this regularly, but I won't if I have to pay shipping and wait for much longer than 2 days for delivery.
56	5	The item came in a timely manner and the pig ears are very good quality.  I will purchase more pig ear dog treats in the future from this vendor.
57	1	After tasting another well-known Italian coffee brand I figured it was the right time for Lavazza. The other well-known brand was smooth and rich. This coffee was extremely acidic, bitter, earthy, and old. Very disappointed in Lavazza, especially with all the great reviews.
58	5	This sandwich spread tastes as good as the other top brand sandwich spreads to me , but is more economical bought by the case !
59	5	Pugs are NOT finicky eaters - still mine gobbles this up and loves it as much as any food I've tried on him. He weighed 18 lbs. when I first started him on this and reminded me of a fat little sausage. He has almost finished one 26 lb. bag and has lost 3 lbs. and is holding at a steady 15 lbs. now. I feed him 1/4 c. in the morning and 1/3 c. in the evening. And....2 - 3 times a week I give him a "treat". The food does what is supposed to. Vet says he couldn't be healthier!
60	4	Alvita changed their lea licorice tea not the same - but my daughter likes it.  She normally uses tea in her tea but she said she does not use tea in licorice tea - it is sweet enough.
61	5	This soup is really delicious if you add 8oz. of smoked turkey to it during cooking...
62	5	My dogs LOVE this product. They beg for them. They also came recommended by our animal trainer.  My only issue is that I took advantage of the Super Shipper Saver and for some reason it took almost a month to get here. VERY VERY slow shipping.
63	5	I've tried a wide selection of k-cups including the big names like Starbucks, Tully's, Donut House, Dunkin Donuts, etc and they all have something in common.. either too watery (weak) or too bitter (strong). I tried Breakfast in Bed based on the reviews and I was not disappointed. It's flavorful without being strong or weak. It's hard to get a cup of coffee from a Keurig that tastes like it was brewed like a normal coffee machine.. this k-cup is the exception.. I'll be stocking up.
64	5	My very picky cat loves Greenies, they are the only treat she will eat now.  The vet said it's a great pick as well.
65	5	I've only had the Vanilla flavor so I can't comment on others but this product tastes great - especially with tea.  It's a subtle flavor that doesn't take away the flavor of the drink added to it.  It's definitely a bit pricey but I think it works better for digestion than any of the popular fiber promising citrus powdered drinks whose contents always seem questionable to me.
66	5	*****<br />Sweet African Green Rooibos Herbal Teasan is a delectable Numi tea.<br /><br />This tea is certified organic and kosher and contains only green rooibos and honeybush. It is from South Africa, made from the same plant as Rooibos (Red Tea), but it is not sun-dried, and it has more anti-oxidants than green tea. It is also rich in phytoestrogens. It has a light, smooth, eathy-woody taste.<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi herbal teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you just want a tasty, high-quality rooibos tea, this one does not disappoint.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****
67	4	Everybody in the family really loved the Izze Sparkling Pomegranate juice. Between the four of us the case only lasted two days. The flavor is crisp and dry with a hint of club soda flavor. I think these could be used as an ingredient for a great wine cooler.
68	5	These cookies have no milk, no egss, no nuts, no gluten and no cholesterol or trans fat, which common sense says should make them taste like cardboard, if not even worse. I don't know how they did it, but these chocolate chip cookies are delicious. They actual taste like chocolate chip cookies should taste. If you've got allergies, try these cookies. You'll love them.
69	5	I agree with the company motto "A Natural Obsession".  I tried a small bag at the local store and immediately bought in bulk online to save about 30 percent.  The flavor of these is very strong, so they are best paired with a food that has a very mild flavor, like steamed vegetables or plain whole grain bread.  Otherwise they compete or clash with the other food.
70	5	Verona is by far the best coffee made by Starbucks. Buying in bean form it has much more flavor than if bought already ground. More robust and richer taste.
71	5	I absolutely love my Torani sugar free chocolate syrup!! It is the best ever!! My coffee is so amazing and I use it in tons of other stuff
72	2	I found this product to be a major disappointment.  I tried the Acai Pomegranate flavor.  It did not taste like either acai berry or pomegranate to me.<br /><br />To use the product, you snip open the packet and mix the powered contents with 8 ounces of water.  It mixed easily and dissolved completely.  The taste was tolerable, but not pleasant.  It was sort of like a bland kool-aid as I drank it, but with a slightly tart aftertaste.<br /><br />As far as being a healthy energy drink, while it has several ingredients which are good for you, the aforementioned fruit flavors, as well as vitamins B-12, C, and D, and some minerals such as zinc, it also contains caffeine.  The maker states that the caffeine is naturally-occurring from green tea extract and is equivalent to the amount of caffeine found in a cup of coffee.  I am not a crusader against caffeine, but what goes up must come down, and if you are going to get "energy" from caffeine that's not really energy in my opinion.<br /><br />I don't think there are any bad things in the drink though, no abundance of man-made junk sweeteners and so on.<br /><br />And it is true it has a good dose of vitamins in it.  The B-12 dose is huge at 2,500 mcg.  You may reap more benefits some vitamin supplements and a nice cup (hot or cold) of green tea, and if you need it you'll still get a dose of caffeine in the tea.<br /><br />Considering the poor flavor, the caffeine "energy" and the price, well over $1 per drink for the packet of powder..... in the end I found Eboost to be quite a let down.
73	5	This bread is great!!  I wanted french bread, but my son is gluten-free, so I started looking.  I found this product.  The french bread is so easy to make and turned out great.  No one knew they were eating gluten-fre, Yea, its that good.
74	5	I love this coffee.  I love my coffee strong and rich tasting and this fits the bill. I will definitely purchase this again.
75	5	When I ordered this product I received free shipping. Since then they have added shipping and it is high. I won't be ordering this again. I have to say my dogs really loved these cookies. I have since bought them in town. Paul Newman makes great products..
76	5	I have a yeast infection in my gut and I have lost 35 Lbs. do to the strict diet I've had to follow, this protein powder has helped me not loose any more weight as I can have it since it's got Stevia and not another type of sweeter that I cannot have.  Love this HEMP protein.
77	5	It was fresh, delivery was fast and the taste was mmmmmgood. I never had Omaha fish before and I am going to see if i can put this on a monthly order. This is a recommended buy
78	5	These noodles are fantastic. I could eat them for dinner almost every night of the week along with their other Annie's counterparts. Cooked meal in less than 30 minutes. You cannot beat the taste! I love adding coconut oil and chia seeds to them as well. It only enhances the flavor and adds some nutritional extras if you so desire. They are fine the way they come but I find this adds something extra and they taste amazing prepared this way.
79	3	I eat a lot of good chocolate like Valrhona, Domori, & Green & Black. Newman's Own is in no way on par with better chocolates, but it is better than average. They tried hard to make it something special but I won't be buying again. There are much better chocolate bars out there.
80	5	My dog loves this dog food - i had to switch her from another joint supplement food because of unavailability issues - and Lucy loves this!!
81	5	These cookies are the best.  They are very crispy and taste great with a bowl of coconut milk ice cream.  The reviewer who thought they had an aftertaste or grainy texture is reacting to something I can't taste at all; these are yummier than all the wheat-based commercial sugar cookies I've tasted.
82	5	I really like this product---when my grocery stopped carrying it, I ordered it through the mail.  This is more of a quick bread than a cake, and it requires a can of cream style corn.  The result is very moist and has a good corn flavor.  I bake it in muffin pans in cupcake papers, and a dozen are small.  It makes about 8 good sized muffins.  I also bake these longer than specified on the package, because I seem to like things that are more done than many people.  These store well in a plastic bag in the refrigerator---if they are not all eaten by the end of the meal.
83	1	I bought this because of the soups I've had by Pacific, most are great... the broths are bleh, too weak and watery, but the tomato ones and *the new veggie lentil and roasted red pepper mmm* are souper-duper.<br /><br />First, the texture... a mix of rice flour thickened broth and creme fraiche and milk, it had separated so one section was clear goopy broth and the other was the creamy-ish part (more starchy than creamy, like potatoes--in this case rice flour--blended with some broth and skim milk, nothing like Campbell's, not condensed enough to work for recipes that need a thick base). I got it when it was a brand new product line by them (new enough to get $1 off coupons, the REAL reason I tried them since they were barely over a dollar after the discount).<br /><br />The smell I agree with the 1-star review is really off putting... and it matches the taste PERFECTLY.<br /><br />What the taste IS? BABY FOOD. JUST LIKE BABY FOOD.<br /><br />When I got the lentil one with the coupon, I only got one... then went back and got the rest, along with a few of these (I haven't braved the mushroom yet). I wish I'd only gotten one. A dollar and change or not, NO WAY am I keeping them. I wouldn't even donate them. I added ground pepper... nope, baby food plus pepper. Sea salt made a bite of it almost edible--yknow, thick salty broth--and adding a touch of herbs just ruined the herbs.<br /><br />The reason it can't be salvaged? Their chicken is repulsive. I'm almost sure they boiled the bird, and that is only acceptable for broth where the bird gets removed. In fact, I have a hunch--especially given the whole thing possessed ONE tiny flaky pea sized square of meat--they got "responsible" and took the bird etc used for the broth--the broth strained out and packaged--and just blended that boiled limp weird-odor meat and such and tossed in some rice flour and dairy to try passing it for soup.<br /><br />Ever made your own broth, the kind where you boil it til the bird is almost Michael Jackson white because you aren't going to use it as part of the dish and want to yank all its flavor out? You know how funky boiled, denatured bird smells and tastes? This is that bird. Now I have finally figured out why baby food is so repulsive, a mystery I was content to never even ponder. I hate that I am dumping the remaining 90% of this out, but I'll be tasting it coming back up if I don't (4 tiny spoonfuls and it already has me belchy and nauseous!). Healthy shouldn't have to taste like wartime rations, not in this day and age.
84	5	I bought all 3 kinds of Kicking Horse coffee and this one, 454 Horse Power, was my favorite. Beans were moist and produced a great flavor. I just wished they offered this type in the 2.2 lb bags. FYI Nice tins though.
85	5	My son hates being sprayed (bug or sunscreen spray). He spends most of his day outside at daycare and mosquitoes find him very sweet.  Now that West Nile has become such an issue here, I am meticulous on making sure he is covered.  These wipes (along with buggy bands) have worked perfectly.  I just wipe him down as he is having breakfast every morning and he is set for the day.
86	5	This product is my dog's absolute favorite when it comes to dog treats. I find them perfect for training... and so does she!
87	4	I am not an expert on teas. I've been drinking grocery-store-bought green tea(Wegman's Brand) for years. I thought I'd try the POP White Peony Tea(Bai Mudan) for additional antioxidant power and to reduce the consumption of fluoride that green tea contains. So I bought four 100-bag boxes. In making my first cup of White Peony, I noticed right away how dark brown the brew was. Is this characteristic of all Bai Mudan teas?  in the past, I would brew two bags of the green tea within one cup of water (and steep it forever at high temps) and it would still only make an amber brew. But only one tea bag of the White Peony after a few minutes of steeping, makes for a dark tea similar to black tea. Again, I am not an expert. Just stating my observations. Is White Peony supposed to be that dark? Thanks, Wayne
88	3	I brewed this coffee with the recommended ratio of water to coffee:  6 oz. water & 2 teaspoons coffee.  It was very weak brewed this way; like coffee-flavored tea.  So I brewed another batch at 3 t coffee to 6 oz. water and it was better.  This is not a bad cup of coffee just not very complex & definitely a medium roast at best.  I brewed some 8 O'Clock Original roast for comparison (I thought that would be a good coffee to compare) & this coffee came in second to that.  This is not a very interesting cup of coffee; serviceable and good for people who don't like a strong brew.  I am not a black, tar coffee lover but I prefer more flavor.<br /><br />If you like a dark roast coffee like Starbucks, you will be underwhelmed.  But if you like Folgers or other grocery store brands, this is definitely a step above.  It is not bitter & it is good with a bit of cream.<br /><br />I brew coffee using the pour-over method, directly in to my stainless carafe.  This is my system:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CFLIL">Melitta Cone Coffee Filters, Natural Brown, No. 6, 40-Count Filters (Pack of 12)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EN8DMU">Copco 2 Quart Thermal Capacity Brushed Stainless Steel Carafe</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012S1V2A">Oster 5965 Stainless-Steel 1-1/2-Liter Electric Water Kettle</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BUDDTY">RSVP Maunual Drip Coffee Filter Cone for Carafes or Thermos</a>
89	5	If you are gluten-free and want crackers, this is the one for you.  It is also delicious.  This is my second order of these.
90	5	The perfect snack for a busy person.  Also great for a quick bite in between meals.  Great way to get the fat and calories you need without eating a carb-filled meal.
91	1	I am not sure on what planet this would be considered cheddar flavored popcorn, but I can assure you it's not on the planet Earth.  It has a bizarre oily flavor that has a bit of a twang to it.  I can't describe it except to say it is not cheddar or any other kind of cheese and it's not good.  In fact it's really rather gross.  No one in my family enjoyed it and after popping one bag, the rest are headed for their final resting place in some garbage dump somewhere.<br /><br />Cherise Everhard, October 2010
92	5	I have been crazy about Italian Torrone Candy ever since our friends brought some back from Italy to my family in the 1950's!  Back then, as a child, I was "hooked" on it after my first bite!  It is not easy to find it in stores, unless you go to an ethnic market in a large city.<br />That thin film on the outside is part of the candy and is edible.  If you are not used to it, I could understand how it would seem strange, or "suspect."<br />I wish I could order more of it, but the price really gets expensive when you have to pay for the shipping too.<br />I would love to find a store that sells it, because I would buy a "ton" of it, and avoid those shipping charges!
93	1	Wickles advertises "sweet" pickles. The product they sent was not sweet but extremely hot. It even had a red hot chilly pepper in the jar. When contacted they told me that the product I received was a sweet pickle because the box it came in said sweet. Nowhere on the jar is the word "sweet". Nutricity did nothing to remedy their mistake and now I am left with 12 jars of "hot" pickles when I ordered 12 jars of "sweet" pickles That I paid over $50.00 for plus shipping. I will never do business with this company and would not recommend anyone else to do so.
94	5	I am a huge Pumpkin Spice fan, and this coffee for the Keurig system is fantastic. Tastes great.  Love it.  If you like pumpkin spice coffee, you will not be disappointed.
95	5	Great for getting good rising action from rye and whole wheat flours, etc. Sounds like a 'too big' size, but if you bake often you know how expensive this stuff is in small supermarket sizes. Keep in fridge or freezer for long lasting freshness.
96	5	I understand that people are disappointed in the product, but there is no reason to give this a one star review.  I carry this in my store and it is a hit with the customers - even Hot Tamales fans like myself.  I agree that it isn't initially what you would expect from something titled "Hot Tamales cotton candy", it isn't spicy and has only a faint cinnamon flavor.<br /><br />However, I love it for that reason.  We carry the Mike & Ike cotton candy as well as the traditional circus colors and the stars and stripes kind.  The Hot Tamales cotton candy is great because it is a break from the fruity flavors.  I can taste the cinnamon, though very faint, but I love it!  And so do our customers, we sell a lot of it.<br /><br />The one star reviews are ridiculous.  As long as you know that it isn't a strong cinnamon flavor, what is there to complain about?  The cotton candy is fresh, super fluffy and tastes great.  Perhaps there is a flaw in the advertising, they should state that the flavor is not overpowering, but if you strip away the Hot Tamales brand and don't give anyone preconceived notions of what the exact taste is, this cotton candy is a hit.<br /><br />I would give it 4 out of 5 stars because a little more cinnamon would definitely be a plus, but I chose to gave it 5 to counter the other 2 overly negative reviews, because it is definitely not as terrible as the others are claiming.  Again, all of my video store customers love it and keep coming back for more.  Take a chance like I did and try it for yourself, after reading this review and choosing to buy it I doubt you will be disappointed.
97	5	This is the only litter I've used since I got my cat, Indy, and it works very well. It clumps almost instantly (hence the name).  Very easy to sift out.  I used to get the big 20lbs (or more) bucket, which was ardous to pour into her box.  I like this smaller jug because it's easier to handle and refill the box with what i need quickly.  I live in an attic apartment.  I keep her litter box at the bottom of the staircase in the back of my apartmen.  My apt has never smelled like a cat bathroom to me or any guests i've had. Indy seems to like it too :)
98	5	I had the pleasure of trying these crackers recently at a friend's home (she's from Australia).  She served them with a mild cheese.  I loved the light flavor; also liked that they weren't dry, bland and "crumbly" like all the other water crackers I've tried.  Even though they're a little pricey, I do plan to order several boxes in the near future.
99	5	I used this in a flower bed that I wanted to keep squirrels out of.  It works well for that.  I sprinkled it on the dirt among the flowers.  It has an unpleasant odor but that wears off after a day or two.  You do need to reapply it while the plants are still young after a rain or every week to 10 days.  When the plants grow and fill in, you don't need to use it anymore because squirrels seem to leave the plants alone then.  (They like to see bare dirt.)  If you're using this for some other critter, I can't really speak to that, but it's great for keeping squirrels away.
100	4	I really like these instant Starbucks decaf tubes.  They make a pretty good tasting cup of coffee, and are very easy.  My 4 star rating is simply because I received product from Amazon that had less than 3 months before the expiration date; I usually see 11-12 months when I buy it in the store.
101	5	This brand of cat food came highly recommended.  We have our baby, "Mr. Bear" who is full blooded Maine Coon.  He is 13 months old and weighs 22 lbs.  We kept him on his kitten food by recommendation of his Dr. and breeders until he was 1 yr old.  When he was 11 months old we started giving him this as a treat to get his system use to it.  When we ran out of the kitten food, he was already use to this food and he loves it!  It is bigger pieces so he has to chew it which helps his dental health and his tummy.  This a great food for him and you WON'T beat this price.
102	5	This is a nice basic selection of gel food colorings which you can make all the basic colors you would need for a beginner.  They mix well with frostings and do not make the frosting runny as with liquid colors.
103	5	I love passion fruit juice and this is a very good product. Each bottle makes about a gallon. It is low in sugar and low on glycemic index. Has a lot of potassium and is a natural relaxer. Makes great cocktails too if it isn't relaxing enough for you straight up! Fast delivery and great product!
104	1	I love Celestial Seasoning's Madagascar Vanilla Red tea, which is sadly becoming harder and harder to find in stores.  But don't order this item.  I placed an order for it, and had the order randomly canceled by the company.  The seller was listed as ABC Wholesale, and it is now listed as RED TAG sale, even though it's the exact same item.  Buy it from another source, it's a great tea.  I personally think it works great in combination with other teas, my favorite is a combination of four bags of this tea and one bag of plum black tea to make a gallon pitcher, which tastes great both hot or cold.
105	5	I ordered fortune cookies for a business training event. They were a hit with the team that received them and gave the message of the training added impact. Greenfire was a hit with me. They were fast. Communication was thorough and every commitment was exceeded. The fortune cookies taste good as well. I'll be using Greenfire again and will recommend them highly.
106	5	this is the best chai tea ever I love it and will always buy this brand it is so good and my kids love it too
107	5	I first tried this at a local german deli after developing a taste for Venco munten drop licorice. Gustav's flavor is more intricate than that of the Venco, more rich, less sweet.
108	5	I really like the "crunchy" chocolate chip cookies . . . the soft ones are chemically softened and, I think, gross.  These have good flavor and are great for trips (although eating anything crunchy in the car is discouraged . . . wait for a rest stop!) and especially for preschooler snacks.
109	5	This is my favorite flavor of Mio by far! Great lemonade taste - and it doesn't taste like artificial sweetener. I devoured the first bottle I got!
110	3	I have purchased DaVinci Gourmet Classic Sugar Free Syrup for a great while during the time Sam's Wholesale offered it and this is simply not the same syrup. I will be looking for a different supplier. If you like it- great. but it is not for me.
111	5	Received seeds in a timely manner. Very efficient. Looking forward to harvesting these unique heirloom tomatoes. Good company. Would deal with them again.
112	5	The colors are very vibrant and easy to use. It takes just a little to get the color effect you are looking for. I would like to see a color chart with instructions on mixing colors and the quantity to get odd/variations of the color.
113	5	Orgain is a great product!  It is an organic drink full of vitamins and minerals, green tea, antioxidants, 16 grams of protein and only 255 calories!  It also tastes great.<br />I am using Orgain to help me lose weight.  It is a perfect meal replacement because the high level of protein keeps me from getting hungry.  I have tried drinks of this nature before and they had a terrible aftertaste and didn't "agree" with my system.  Not so with Orgain.  I drink the chocolate flavor and it tastes like chocolate milk to me.<br />My son uses this product as a protein drink after workout.  It works very well for him.  He actually researched the product for us and found that it was developed by a physician that had been through cancer treatments.  He wanted to develop a drink that was very healthy that he could have when he couldn't handle regular food.  Orgain was the result.<br />I would highly recommend Orgain for a dieter, a sports enthusiast, and someone on the go needing a healthy meal replacement.
114	5	I just wish the vendors were more realistic in pricing. Yes I know the dollar is weaker but the prices are almost gouging.
115	4	The container is better for the environment and the coffee is very good.  I have tried Fog Chaser, French Roast and Rainforest Blend.  All are very good.
116	4	Just a cautionary note: I bought the 50 pack this summer, and just noticed that they packs expire at the end of November 2010. If you are a fast and furious VIA drinker this would not be a problem, but I only drink them at work, etc etc. I actually find a whole packet to be too strong; I prefer to use half a packet per cup, which is cheaper of course, and allows you to justify the occasional splurge on the "real thing".
117	5	My kids enjoy this organic tea with a spot of honey in it, Especially before bedtime in the winter. It's been a big hit at our house and the large quantity allowed us to give some away as gifts.
118	5	My baby loves this product. I even tried it and it was very yummy. I cant wait to get more for him.
119	3	Know what you are getting here.  These Ambrosoli-Honees Energy Plus Vitamin Honey drops are candy disguised as something else: energy boost, source of vitamins B6, B12, and C, and honey.<br /><br />They'll taste honey-like, with a soft center, but the thing is mainly sugar and high fructose corn syrup.  Use this to fulfill your vitamin needs and you'll probably add a few pounds while putting a few dollars in the pocket of your dentist.<br /><br />If you've ever chewed honeycomb, then you'll have a sense for the consistency of these drops when you start masticating.<br /><br />Oh, that continual search for a magic wellness bullet!
120	1	Though I don't know if this particular one is recalled.<br />But I just thought I'd try to give a heads up.<br />So, this is not a true review about this products features per say.....but I feel that everyone needs to know that this company has recalled their products and it is going on right now.<br />To begin with, I want to say that I know that unfortunately there are plenty of human products that get recalled too and that is the most important thing. And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too.<br />But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too.<br /><br />Many years ago I did research to find the best priced grain free,no dye or by product food.<br />I found that some of the food made by Diamond Pet Foods had the first ingredient as being the actual real meat.<br />Plus,the grain free ones made my baby girl look so healthy and shiny.<br />Also,since it had no fillers and quality ingredients it actually made her stool smaller and less stinky.<br />She has less allergies and it stopped most of her constant itching/biting/licking at her paws and less tear stains.<br />She actually loved the product, by the same maker, named "Taste Of The Wild" in Bison the most.<br /><br />But,I am saddened now because Diamond Dog Food has now been RECALLED for "SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION"<br />This company makes various products that have been recalled.<br />Such as:<br />Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.<br /><br />I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these "better than store" dog food and they keep getting recalled!<br />So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the "better" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients.<br />I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week.<br />My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now.<br />I am sickened by these companies being so careless. When the reason we buy their higher priced food is cuz they are suppose to be healthier!<br />I just wanted to write this and try to stop another baby from getting sick or even worse dying
121	5	well the replaced the coconut oil (now that's it's considered healthy) with soybean oil...but there's coconut in there for the overall taste.<br />in case your not an oldtimer...this is how you eat them....fill a large glass with<br />cookies...add ice cold milk to cover cookies ...grab a spoon....now just say mmmmmmmm
122	4	I recently bought this roland rice, because it comes in 20 pound bags and where i live i can't get rice in that quantity. I found it to be very good, but requires a bit more washing then most, and is a little drier tasting. Nothing really bad though, just let cook for a little longer and its great! will defiantly be buying more.
123	5	I tried these for the first time about a year ago; then my market stopped carrying them (lack of shelf space).  So I took the web address off the package and ordered online.  No way I was going to miss out on this delicious and amazing chip.  I even saw a program on how they were made and loved it even more.  The best; not too spicy; CRISP AND CRUNCHY.  Simply terrific!!!
124	5	These pork rinds are the ticket! Delicious!<br />Once you master eye-balling the rise of the bag and when to stop those microwaves, you will be soooo delighted!<br />All the rind pieces have been  puffing up  nicely  for me and when dipped in Blue Cheese dressing with tabasco sauce, oh that is part of the good life guys !!<br />Order arrived  in great shape flawless transaction - will be back  for more!
125	5	I can't quite describe the taste of this soda, but I'll try. It's fizzy and apply, and it kind of reminds me of Dr. Pepper a little bit, except it's lighter in flavor. It's just really, really good and refreshing. And it is made with real apple juice and cane sugar, so there's that too. If you get an opportunity to try it, do so. It's good!
126	3	It is approximately 8 cups of seasoning.  With 1/4 cup recommended per 1 lb meat, that's about 16 meals.  In my grocery store, taco seasoning pouches would have to be .25 each to beat this.  The best price I've seen in years is .33 and that's due to grocery wars going on in my town right now.  The flavor is nice, but something about it doesn't match other taco seasoning pouches.  I feel like I need to add a little something each time.  It is strong so I may be able to get by with 3 Tbsp instead of a full 1/4 cup and that would make it an even better deal.
127	5	I really like these little iperespresso pods. They are so easy to use with none of the clean-up of my old machine. I bought the (Gaggia for illy) machine based on the fact that it uses these pods. The Francis Y1 is another good choice. All the favours are great, but Decaf is our house favorite. We have went through 3 tins in 2 weeks. The coffee is strong yet silky smooth with great crema. It tastes great as a latte with some steamed milk, or an iced Latte, over ice with a splash of milk. Don't be fooled into thinking these machines and the pod system doesn't work, they do work, and they really do make great espresso.
128	5	The best pistachios, but be careful. You can easily eat too many of these since you don't have to crack the shells. I deffinately recommend these nuts to all you nut-lovers out there! I'm NUTS for them!!
129	4	The flavor of this tea is very light, even though I steeped it a very long time. It's just a little bit chocolate and only very slightly sweet. I add a packet of stevia and a little bit of almond-coconut milk and THAT makes it tastes a bit more like dessert.<br /><br />It absolutely does give a nice, even release of energy. I never crash and, even if I have a cup in the afternoon, it doesn't keep me so riled up that I can't sleep. I really like it for that reason.<br /><br />I'd love to see a chocolate spice flavor from this brand. I think it would help make it a little more favorful!
130	5	Kind Bars are great snacks to take care of the inevitable afternoon hunger pang. I love having them around to grab and go. Favorite flavors are the Mango Macadamia, Cranberry Almond and Apricot Almond.  Great price when you buy them on Subscribe & Save as well.
131	5	My child, in a word, literally inhales these things! They smell & taste great and i would expect them to have a higher sugar content but they're actually a pretty good snack alternative, esp in comparison with fish crackers, cheetos, etc... You may find yourself sneaking a few :)
132	5	We use it at night to lower diabetes sugar and it works.  My husband has been able first to reduce the medications and now has been off for 2 months.  Of course this is together with exercise, weight reduction and proper nutrition.
133	4	Finally, a French Roast K-cup that taste like..., a french roast. I tried a couple of the other brands french roast and didn't think any of those were very good and came across as just regular weak coffee. This one, while not as good as if I had used my drip coffee maker, taste really good for a K-Cup. Has a nice smooth taste and full bodied taste. Has no bitterness. An very good French Roast K-cup.
134	1	This product was the worst - it was so stale, even the dog didn't eat it (and she eats everything). It had such a stale taste to it I thought for sure the product was years old but there was no expiration date on it. None the less - it went in the garbage.
135	5	My sweet pooch loves these treats! She will do anything I ask as long as I have a hand full of these babies. And they are all natural and don't hurt her tender tummy. Great product!
136	5	I have a Keurig in the office for guests (and myself) but I learned that most of my guests prefer a lighter roast than I do. After tasting the Veranda Blend, I found it was light, but very aromatic and you could still add sugar and cream and it was very similar to a good restaurant coffee. So when supplying choices of blends for guests, I'm including Veranda as a milder blend for those who don't like French Roast or Sumatra or other bold blends. I find that there is a bit of woodiness, but also a slight flavor of nuts and cocoa. It's a pleasant blend of coffee and a very good cup if you don't want something awfully strong. Some lighter roasts are acid to me, but this one seems to be balanced.
137	4	This is pretty spicy. As soon as I opened it, I got the spicy smell of peppers. I did not use it as a dipping sauce. I used it as a marinade and then as a topping for several different pork flavors. I think it could be a bit stickier and glazier (if that's even a word) My issue was that it didnt stick well to pork to create a crust/glaze but ran off to the sides and burned. Not bad over all.
138	5	Angel Cat has been begging for her daily CET Chew for several years!<br /><br />She loves them.  Paddy, my other cat will not try them.  Guess which cat has<br /><br />healthy, clean teeth and breath?  Angel.  Poor Paddy is scheduled to get<br /><br />his teeth cleaned and have two extractions soon.  Sure wish he would try<br /><br />them.  How wonderful to get them for much less than with the Vet who<br /><br />prescribed them!
139	5	This stuff is delicious and Amazon has the best price on it that I've seen so far (around $2.10 a bottle)<br /><br />I'm a chocolate addict and this stuff is my waistlines saving grace, it's only 120 calories a bottle and I drink half of it at a time. It's also got all the health benefits of regular coconut water (potassium,iron and electrolytes)<br /><br />It's still a little expensive but it's a real treat and I will definitely buy this product again.
140	1	I ended up throwing them all out because they were extrememly tough and not very tasty.
141	5	The easiest way for that Black Bean and Cheese burrito fix which afflicts many of us. Add a Low Carb, Whole Wheat Tortilla shell and you are good to go. I can taste it now.
142	5	This is a great price and was very worth it with free shipping.  I use it every day.  It is much healthier than sugar or Equal.
143	2	I think that the Tabasco folks tried sincerely to make this a good sauce: the basic idea was to mix a high-quality Worcestershire with Tabasco.  It should have worked, but I just think they misunderstood the things that make the classic Worcestershire so appealing.  Maybe they just opted for smoked anchovies or something, but this sauce has an unpleasant smoky, almost bacon-y undertone to it.  I've tried it again and again, hoping I'd get used to the difference, but in the end I had to chuck it in the trash.  From a man who has ordered and enjoyed multiple gallon jugs of Tabasco Regular and Habanero Sauces: this one is just not a winner.
144	4	This granola crunch, intended to be eaten like trail mix, has a well balanced flavor between all of the ingredients.<br /><br />The chocolate chunks and dried berries are small and easily mix in a handful. And the coconut flavor is quite pronounced. It is a perfect size for storing in a desk drawer at work or somewhere climate controlled. With the real chocolate, these could have a problem if you carry it camping or leave it in your car on a hot day.<br /><br />Here is the list of ingredients as shared by Natures Path:<br /><br />Made with love and...<br />Rolled oats*, evaporated cane juice*, soy oil*, rolled spelt (wheat)*, dark chocolate chunks* (evaporated cane juice*, unsweetened chocolate*, cocoa butter*, soy lecithin*, vanilla*), flax seeds*, dried coconut*, cocoa*, freeze-dried berry blend* (freeze-dried strawberries*, freeze-dried raspberries*), rice starch*, sea salt, natural chocolate flavor, natural vanilla flavor, tocopherols (natural vitamin E). *Organic. Produced in a facility that uses dairy and peanuts. Contains soy, tree nuts and wheat.
145	5	My daughter is allergic to wheat, milk, eggs, soy, peanuts, and oats.  This is a great replacement to chocolate chips off the store shelf!  These chunks taste great in cookies, pancakes, and right out of the bag.
146	1	If this has salt and sesame I'll eat my hat. OK, it has salt but apparently so little that it's not able to register on the tongue. Perhaps my hat might have more flavor.<br /><br />Ordered some Marmite to go w/ it; maybe that will help. Unfortunately, the item is not returnable or I would have chosen that option: this is THAT bad.
147	5	The strong, spicy aroma (clove and cinnamon dominate) makes this flavor my favorite of the black tea offerings.  Could easily pass for potpourri with it's wonderful bouquet. The flavor stands up well to cream and sugar/honey if that's how you take your chai.
148	5	I just started drinking tea three months ago. Started with a Whole Foods brand green tea. Taste is sort of blah but I'm used to it now. Was having some insomnia around that time and came across this Yogi Bedtime tea.  I have to say that I am sold. This tea is absolutely delicious. I can not wait to drink a cup every night (and have not missed a night since I started drinkiing it). Additionally, my sleeping has never been better in my entire lifetime.<br /><br />Amazon's subscribe and save price is a great deal too. I pay $3.99 a box at Whole Foods. On Amazon, I can get six boxes for $12.70. (my last order was $17 and I thought that was a great price.)
149	5	I needed an oil with a high smoke point that was healthy (trans fat free) and gluten free and this oil is perfect.<br /><br />I don't often deep fry but I from time to time I like to make gf doughnuts and this oil worked extremely well.  Light doughnuts, without the greasy taste.  I'm very pleased and will be ordering again.  Glad to see it here on Amazon.
150	5	My kids, ages 8, 5, 4, 3 and 2, love the taste of this drink (they did not like the chocolate one).  We mix it with juice and water.  Water help its dissolve better.  I love that I am able to give them extra fruits/veggies each day with one great tasting drink.  Good source of antioxidants and has a wonderful alkalizing effect on their bodies.
151	5	So far, all the Kashi Granola Cereal I have tried have been great.  This is no exception.  I use it in a parfait (which is an idea I stole from McDonald's).  I put a serving of vanilla non-fat yogurt in a bowl.  I then add my Kashi Granola Cereal.  On top of that I put any available fresh or frozen (I warm it in the microwave) fruit.  Instant and healthy for you meal, dessert, or snack.
152	5	I usually buy One Earth Cat Litter at PCC.  Their stock is somewhat limited, so I thought I would order it from you...at twice the price, I don't think so!
153	5	My cat will eat NOTHING but Whiskas Beef in Gravy cat food. Being able to order and receive it through the mail has been a blessing. I get it for my mom because she cannot drive to the store because of her health issues. Its great not to have the extra burden of getting cat food. Her cat is her companion through hard times.
154	5	Please be aware that this product, like any other supplement or energy drink you can try, will have different effects for each user. To think that it would react the same for everybody would be saying that everybody has the same exact body shape and health, metabolism, etc. Personally, it works wonders for me. I am 20 and in fit shape, and it does a perfect job of keeping me awake and focused at work. I drink one on days when I didn't get enough sleep the night before, and within 5 minutes I can go from stumbling around with heavy eyes to being alert and productive. For me personally, there is no crash afterward, I simply return to however I was before I took the drink. My only concern is the possible long-term effects, but since I do not use it on habit, just on those days when I really need it, I am not really worried about it. Highly recommended, but do not feel scammed if it doesn't work for you. It simply might not be as effective on your body.
155	5	Anyone looking for quick, delicious, healthy snack should definitely put these on their shopping list. They come individually wrapped which makes them perfect for taking along with you when running around and they're very filling with the whole grains and rolled oats.
156	3	Previously bought marzipan potatoes but they were sold out, so tried these. Niederegger marzipan is the best I've ever tasted but the chocolate is overpowering. The potatoes were better because they were pure marzipan and the flavor really comes through.
157	5	I had this syrup in a drink in Brussels Belgium and I had to have it at home.  It is awesome!!!!!
158	5	I bought this purely because of the novelty but both me and my boyfriend drank the health and mana potions we bought.The taste terrible and nasty but afterward you're good to go for 10-12 hours of long lasting no crashing energy.It works far better than coffe or energy drinks.It doesn't make you jittery or loose focus.I found that this drink actually made me awake and aware and I was able to perform my better at my job after barely any sleep.I'm going to order several twelve packs of this!
159	5	I love this mix.  The best muffin mix I have found.  It also makes great pancakes, waffles, and banana bread.  I send it to my daughter wherever she is stationed around the world.  You can't beat it if you like to or have to bake, especially for kids.
160	5	Very high quality chocolates. I had to ration them. Will buy again, and again, and again.... I was introduced to these as a gift, and now i give them as gifts. Great buy.
161	5	Canfield's Diet Soda Chocolate Fudge is amazing! No Fat, No Sodium, No Carbs, No Calories, No Caffeine....just amazing fuzzy satifying chocolate taste! I can not find it in California, so thank chocolate goodness for Amazon!
162	5	Of course it's a matter of taste, but I'll join the small chorus in singing the praises of this wonderful tea. To date, I have not been disappointed by Mighty Leaf (the Organic Breakfast is another favorite). However, I should issue a warning: If you serve Mighty Leaf Vanilla Bean to guests after dinner, be prepared to pour a second cup!
163	5	I like Royal Canin very much. The design makes my German Shepherd puppy chew his food and not gulp it (like he did with his old food). I like the smell of it. It does not give him the doggy breath. His teeth seem to stay more clean. His coat has retained its shine. The ingredients are perfect (meats first!).<br />However, it is about $20 cheaper if you can find a retailer near you that you can buy it from. Your veterinarian might know of someone. My vet uses Royal Canin for her dogs, so I am going to buy it from her from now on.<br />Great product! Too pricey on Amazon though....
164	5	Very reasonable in price and value. Easily digestable and protein absorption was through the roof! The taste, well, it tastes like dust, but hey, it works! I mixed it slowly in other foods or drinks. I used the hemp chocolate shake to flavor it, but be careful of too much fiber. But it is an excellant product!!!!!
165	5	I love this product!  I use it as an ingredient in my homemade protein bars but also have tried it every way I can think of.  As a peanut butter junkie, I was not sure I would like this, but its great.  Mixed per the instructions with water and I think it tastes as good or better than most commercial brands and without the fat.  Okay, but I am lazy, too. I empty the original package into a glass container with a snap on lid.  I find it easier to get the product out without spilling this way.  It also makes it easy to dip bananas for each bite.  Sprinkles on vanilla or chocolate ice cream? You betcha!  Here is one that sounds weird, but don't knock it until you try it.  Mix two tbsps. powder with one tbsp. water and five or six drops of your favorite hot sauce.  Spread this over a freshly grilled hamburger and enjoy.  It sort of tastes like Thai beef satay, only better and juicier.  It is a little pricey at this size and I am hoping to find larger, bulk sizes.
166	5	This product is a bit on the sweet side, but does the trick if you are looking for a sweet snack that is not a million calories and fat.
167	5	When we got our dog (rescue mutt) I did a lot of research about dog food, which helped me tremendously with how to analyze the ingredient list to find the right food.  But doing that research still leaves you with a pretty decent-sized list of high-quality foods.  I've tried several and our dog definitely has her own opinions.  She was fine with some for awhile, but then got tired of them, Blue Buffalo being one example.  Others she just turned her nose up at right from the start--surprisingly including Taste of the Wild, which most dogs seem to be crazy about.  But the Wellness CORE original recipe has been something she's liked consistently for a long time now.<br /><br />She's never had any allergy issues with this product, her eyes and coat look great, she has tons of energy and, thank heavens, no gas.  In the fall and winter she eats windfall apples and the stench is beyond belief, so I'm grateful that the rest of the year the Wellness CORE keeps her gas-free!<br /><br />If you're looking for a high-quality, grain-free dry food for your dog, give Wellness CORE a try.
168	2	As a long-time Stakich customer, I have noticed extreme inconsistency in their raw honey products. One time the honey is very dark in color, and the next time it is very light. One time the honey is very soft (almost like soup) and the next time it is very hard and can barely be removed with a spoon. When I call them, they tell me to heat it up to soften it up. The taste is also inconsistent, but they always have an excuse for that.<br /><br />The owner Steven can be difficult to deal with. He is very selective about which of your emails he will respond to and has a "my way or the highway" attitude! He once double-charged my credit card for a single order. It took me several days of fighting with both Stakich and my bank to figure out what happened and to get it straightened out. After some fighting, Steven finally agreed to offer me a free gift, but the catch was that it had to be on my NEXT order....figures, right? So when it came time to reorder, Steven was very rigid and did not allow me to have any input whatsoever in my free gift. He tried to offer me a bracelet /shrug. I tried to be very reasonable and I chose 5 different options that I felt would be appropriate. Steven chose to ignore my emails. I emailed him again, and he responded that he could not make a profit if he chose one of my options. I made him aware that my choices were cheaper on his site than the bracelet and he once again ignored my email. I then emailed him and told him that I was taking my business elsewhere where it would be more appreciated. He once again chose to ignore my email.<br /><br />Bottom line: I rate their product with 3/5 stars because of quality control issues, and I rate their management and people skills 1/5 stars. Trust me when I say this...you are worth very little to them as a customer. It is their way or the highway and they don't care if you go elsewhere. I was a loyal customer of over 10 years and they let me go over $10. I spent well over $1000 with Stakich and they greedily argued with me over a $10 item. I will shop elsewhere even if it costs me a little bit more.
169	5	Mmmmmm!  I just picked up a bag of these at the store.  I am so pleased that I selected the peppermint bark.<br /><br />Don't cram the whole thing in your mouth, chomp away, and swallow.  You'll miss all the good stuff.  Chew slowly . . . the mint and chocolate will mingle (and how I LOVE dark chocolate!) . . . and then there are the little crunches from the itty bitty pieces of peppermint.  Mmmmmm . . . my mouth smiles and goes to heaven.<br /><br />These are perfect.  I plan to get more before the holiday season is over!
170	5	It's good to have an organic instant coffee that tastes good.  Very simple, less waste in the morning when I can make one cup at a time.
171	5	This granola is a good tasting and very crunchy.  I like to eat it as a quick snack on the go or I put some on my cereal. I would recommend this granola.
172	2	If you can trick yourself into thinking that Arctic Zero is a real treat, then more power to you. I can't. The texture is like ice cream that melted and was then refrozen. I usually take those back for a refund. But the worst offence is that there is very little taste. It's like eating a pint of ice with one drop of flavor on it. I took about 10 bites and couldn't go on. It's been sitting in my freezer ever since. I think the problem is that there is ZERO fat in the product. Fat is critical to taste. The manufacturers would be better off trying for a 250 calorie per pint mixture that includes a little bit of fat to help boost the flavor. If you're looking for a lo-cal treat, I'd suggest a couple of organic apples, which have about the same number of calories and the same volume.
173	5	I first sampled this tea while on a cruise.  I prepared it in the evening when I did not want any caffine.  It has a distinct and strong flavor.
174	5	Other Glutten free crackers are hard and tasteless.  However, these multi grain crackers were not.  They had a crisp crunch and were also very tasty.  I put PB&J on them and also ate them alone.<br />I will be ordering again!
175	5	We have used Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats for several years.  It's our 110 lb. hound's favorite treat and great to use for training. It's a fairly expensive treat but if used properly lasts quite a while. I would definitely recommend.
176	5	I had my son early and was having issues when pumping, he had to stay in the NICU. It became very frustrating til my boyfriend bought me this tea. At first it tasted horrible but I was willing to do what I needed to for my baby. Since starting the tea I have not had any lactation issues which helps with giving my preemie baby what he needs to get out of the hospital.
177	5	SO GOOD.<br />Just in case anyone was wondering. I know every vegan/vegetarian says this, but even my carnivorous brother liked it. He's the crazy outdoors type though- savage all the way, carving things out of wood, building shelters in the woods, survival stuff. So I trust his meat-comparison ratings. Most veggie people, when it comes to fake meat, tend to say "it's all about the sauce". While this is true, this also has the texture. It's more of the soft slim-jim texture I remember (though we can argue- is that really meat? hah)- moist and moderately chewy. I'm curious if sticking these in a dehydrator will make them more jerky like. Anyway I like the mesquite lime. It's not too sweet, tangy and just delicious. I recommend!
178	2	Great concept.  However, problem is with the bags - are they using "thinner" paper?  I tried "ice tea" bags first, that you brew briefly.  I don't know if I am squeezing the bags too hard (when I remove from pitcher) but they broke, causing loose tea in pitcher.  Tried "cold brew" - same thing!  Bags appear fine in box; box was sealed in cellophane, undamaged.  I would rather go back to the original tea bags and brew!  At least they didn't break!
179	4	Flavor of this broth was spot on!  I have been to many Vietnamese restaurants for this soup and the flavor was quite similar to this product.  My only complaint was that it was a bit too salty for my taste.  I added an extra quart of water to dillute but it was still too salty.  Next time, I may use a bit less of the beef base.  I would definately recommend this product.
180	5	Timothy's World Hazelnut Decaf Coffee is great tasting for decaf coffee.  Excellent service. Product arrived within 4 days after ordering.
181	5	This is one of my very favorite Earl Grey teas.  The rich bergamot flavor really comes through after steeping for 5 minutes.  Love it!
182	5	I found this to be a good alternative to whey based protein powder. I have only used this product for 30 days and am reordering. Before I get into my review, I might mention that I never thought of myself as whey or lactose intolerant, but after 3 months of taking quality whey protein I knew that what I was experiencing was not typical. (I'm talking about bathroom habits including frequency and consistency). I asked a few older guys in the gym what there experience was with whey, most if not all where fine with it and experienced no problems or side effects. One natural BB that is about my age late 30's suggested this egg based protein product and noted that one of his training customers found it to be an acceptable alternative to the milk based protein products.<br /><br />I did some research and to be honest the manufactures web site for beHealthyNFit is totally useless and outdated with little or no useful information. Their poor web site almost made me not buy this product. It sure didn't invoke any consumer confidence and in my opinion is totally unacceptable.<br /><br />How does it taste? I bought the chocolate (I'm not a chocolate lover but I think chocolate flavoring is the best option for protein powders) The flavor is chocolate but its defiantly not a rich milk chocolate and it wouldn't fall in the same category as a dessert. More of a taste that you can get used to.  I have also seen this flavor described as chocolate with a hint metallic. I'd agree with that. It has an after taste that some may find metallic.<br /><br />How does it mix? I mix this with water directly in a 16oz. ready to drink water bottle. I drink 1 or 2 ounces, usually down to the top of the label. Then I place a funnel in the top and dump in one scoop. Usually I will need to shake or tap the funnel to get the powder to pass through. Then I screw the top on and shake well. I have found that if the water is very cold the powder will clump more often and mix poorly. Room temperature water or water that is cool but not ice-cold works best. I use a wine fridge to keep the water at 50.( I don't like clumps) Note: The consistency is exactly like water, if your expecting this to be a thick or heavy drink then will be disappointed.<br /><br />I found that if you live in a humid state like Florida you will need to make sure that you screw the lid to the protein power on tight. If you expose this power to high humidity you will have a terrible time with it clumping and mixing properly.<br /><br />General tips for drinking protein drinks. I have found that eating a granola bar while drinking a protein drink helps. First biting the granola bar then taking a drink. I found this to work for me and it makes the occasional protein clump less noticeable.<br /><br />Is there room for improvement? Yes, loads of room for improvement. Is there anything better? I haven't found it yet but I am still looking. I will give this high marks until I find something better. Please leave a comment if you find a better non whey protein product.
183	5	I've tried the other teas but when I open the package of this tea the freshness comes out. The tea has a great peppermint flavor. If you're trying to diet then mix it with ginger root tea and it has a great flavor by themselves without adding the calories of sweeteners. It won't taste sweet but it will taste good. Drink it practically everyday.
184	1	We bought this for our Paramount 6 oz popper. We were disappointed by the taste. We've been using LouAna Coconut oil (~[..] from Walmart for 31.5 fl.oz.), Act II popcorn salt and O.R. kernels. After the first mouthfuls of Great Northern Popcorn, people were pushing their bowls aside---it tasted like salted cardboard. Never again---so disappointed.
185	5	great oatmeal and with the special deal less than half the price in the local stores!
186	5	I find the Jack Links Teriyaki Beef Steaks excellent in taste and loaded with protein without a lot of fat nor a lot of carbohydrates, and excellent choice for camping, trips etc. the price thru Amazon can not be beat.  I am very satisfied.
187	5	Once you try this piece of chocolate you will fall in love with it. Probably one of the best nonbar chocolates produced in Switzerland and Europe as a whole. And I think it is rather cheap for the quality you get.
188	5	Numi has done it again.  This is just a fantastic tea.  Normally I do not like anything with Jasmine in it as I find it overpowering but Numi is an exception.  I really enjoyed this tea and the combination of magnolia and jasmine was just right so nothing was too strong.  I also like the fact that it is low in sugar, carbs, and calories.  One 12oz bottle has 45 calories, 12g carbs, and 11g sugar.  Compare that to most other bottled teas on the market today and that is pretty low.  There isn't a 'fake' sugar flavor or aftertaste as it's sweetened with organic honey, agave, and evaporated cane juice.  Plus, on the label it's stamped 'USDA organic', 'certified organic by QAI', 'Kosher & Pareve', and 'Halal'.  It's a fantastic natural product.  I didn't order through Amazon though - I got it directly from the Numi website, but I wanted to leave a review here for others.
189	5	Excellent crunch. Very fresh. Big size bags. These are not exactly what you enjoy in Mexico, but they are very close. Great flavor. For anyone that has never had these or the ones in Mexico, they are in for a real treat. Just add to your super saver freight order and the price is well worth it.
190	5	Gloria Jean's Coffee is delicious. Hazelnut is my favorite flavor. It is convenient that this coffee comes in boxes of 50 so I do not have to stock up on k-cups very often and the price is very good.
191	4	My son loves these pouches. It is a quick and easy way to get fruits and veggies into a picky eater. He loves the flavor and will grab these from me and eat the entire pouch.<br /><br />I love that it is organic and healthy. The fruits overpower the veggies which helps in making the flavor more acceptable to younger children.<br /><br />It is easy to grab on the way out of the door as a quick snack or as a complement to eating out.<br /><br />I highly recommend!
192	1	It is always a huge disappointment when a product that you have relied on for years destroys its merits in search of a new image. Cytomax has ruined a good product with the "remake" it has imposed on its product line. It is now made with an artificial sweetener (Stevia) and has a quite different taste and different nutritional values. I will not buy this new version.
193	3	With my son's nut allergy, I'm always on the lookout for safe snacks.  We get a little tired of rice krispie treats & goldfish around here!<br />These were pretty pricey for the amount of food contained, but for a pre-packaged safe snack we thought we'd give them a try.<br />Basically, like other reviewers, my son picked out the pieces he liked & now I have a pantry full of leftover bits from these.<br />He liked the fruit snacks, but we can find peanut-safe fruit snacks fairly easily in the grocery store.<br />He also liked the chocolate cookie, but it's pretty hard & crumbly.<br />We both liked the trail mix enough to go hunt it down & buy it with subscribe & save here on Amazon.  The flavor included is mountain mambo, which we LOVE.  We also bought bags of the other flavor, beach bash, which is sweeter, with dried pineapple but no chocolate chips (my son loved the little chocolate chips in the mountain mambo).<br />The crackers & sunbutter were left over.<br />I think sunbutter is great - sweeter than soybutter & tastes more like real peanut butter to me, but my son is so used to soybutter that he wants nothing to do with the sunbutter packet (which was the main reason we bought these - to have portable small portions of sunbutter).<br />I occasionally will eat the sunbutter on the crackers, but the crackers are tough - not very kid-friendly.<br />Overall I think it's a handy snack if you're going hiking or camping, but probably won't work for us.  We might use the parts for a roadtrip or everyday snack, but it really costs too much to pick apart like we did.
194	5	I was sick of spending $1.25 per bag from our vending machine at work, and just don't have the self control to buy a big bag & ration it out.  I was thrilled I found these on Amazon as are so much cheaper to buy in bulk, and since individually wrapped keeps me in check for portion control. I love this flavor & now I'm stocked up for a few weeks, & will definately order more when I've eaten these.
195	5	Xylitol is a great tonic for dental health and this is a great price for an excellent delivery medium .. Tastes good and chews well - long lasting flavor.
196	1	It tasted like slightly flavored watered down coconut water. I've had coconut water before and it tasted much better. I did not like it.
197	5	BUT HE LOVES IT. My 5 month old LOVES these mixtures. I promised I would never feed him something that I wouldn't eat myself. They ALL taste good. I would eat any of them if I was so inclined to eat a pureed meal. They are easy to pack & throw in the diaper back/suit case for travel. I had no worry about them leaking (like a small plastic tupperware). The price is right, shipping was quick, and they store really well in the pantry in the ready made box. Happy Baby = Happy Mommy
198	5	Excellent balance with a slightly sweet taste and wonderful aroma. Since it's not overly strong or hot, it's very versatile with any number of dishes.  Stores well in the fridge and the value for the money is fantastic. If you like curry, this is a great buy.
199	5	We bought our CBTL machine, the Americano (currently sold at BBB and ShopNBC and CBTL stores) around 2 months ago. We could not be more pleased with our purchase. Unlike Keurig it has 2 different pressure settings so you can get a real espresso. It produces excellent espressos. We are primarily coffee drinkers though and I have tried a wide variety. So far all of them have been good with the exception of the Kona which is just too light for my taste. But of all the ones we have tried the Viennese is my favorite.<br /><br />It is incredibly smooth and non-bitter. I have never had a bitter CBTL but this is the smoothest of the lot. Yet you still get a rich coffee taste and just a hint of sweetness. The French is my second favorite and if you like strong coffee you might like the French better. But this is just a perfectly balanced cup of coffee. I use the 10 ounce setting and it comes out perfect for me. I haven't had a better cup of coffee from any machine and I really don't think I have had one at a coffee shop either. Highly recommended.
200	5	I get this product since where I live there is no place to buy it,.<br />product is original, great condition, fast service.
201	4	I got this toy along with about 10 others between Amazon and Petco and this one by far has stood up to my dog's chewing. He is an active chewer and this toy seems to be his favorite. The only reason I gave this a 4 instead of a 5 is that the little treats that are attached go very quickly so I will have to look into some more, but he does like it either way. Note: Our dog is a 9 month old English Springer Spaniel.
202	5	For almost nine years I've followed an eating plan called Eat For Your Type. Foods are classified by beneficial, neutral and avoid. Durham wheat, whole wheat, tomatoes and other goodies are no-no's for me and let me tell you trying to find pasta that that don't have those ingredients is no easy deal. I found Eddie's pasta and it was perfect!!! However, it's not easy to find. How excited I was to find I can order it here! It is a great pasta. The colors add so much the prepared dish. I love it!!!
203	5	Popchips are so flavorful and light. They are not greasy like Lays or any other regular potato chip, and it is softer than a pretzel. Popchips are so good, light, and crunchy yet fluffy. Pick your favorite flavor and try popchips. you will not regret it!
204	5	The coconut sugar is so delicious and sweetens as normal sugar does but it feels healthier. By itself it taste a little like coconut but once mixed in your drink it doesn't change the taste. We tried it with lemonade and it was very good. We baked a "healthy" flan and it was delicious! I highly recommend it. Enjoy!
205	5	I have a gluten allergy and these are the best cookie mix , they realy do taste like sugra cookies and you can add what ever chips you want to them i add peanutbutter some times .. they are so good i served them and people didnt even know they were gluten free , my daughter who is soo picky loved them.
206	4	to explain, the product description lists the item as milk chocolate but it is actually DARK CHOCOLATE!! For some, this can mean the difference in the gift being eaten or sat on a table for months. In my case, the gifted person does not like dark chocolate but the cookies are great looking in appearance. They got here in a reasonable time period, in time for the day in question. The container is a clear plastic and clear side top attached to a white bottom with trim.
207	5	I highly recommend this tea, as it actually has flavor to it, unlike most pre-packaged teas available on store shelves. The "brewtach&eacute;"s included make it easy to pour a perfect cup and get optimal flavor at the same time. Plus, the manufacturer's committment to organic and trade-friendly production is also noteworthy.
208	5	I WAS SCEPTICAL AT FIRST ABOUT A SANDWICH, GLUTEN FREE COOKIE.  BOY WAS I WRONG!  THEY TASTE GREAT!  HOWEVER, I HAD TO STOP EATING THEM, I AM ALLERGIC TO POTATO!  WHAT A BUMMER.  I WANTED A SANDWICH COOKIE AND THIS FIT THE BILL.  I BOUGHT A CASE, TOOK SOME COOKIES TO WORK AND EVERYONE IN THE OFFICE LOVED THEM.  (I AM THE ONLY ONE WITH CELIAC DISEASE IN THE OFFICE)  SO WHEN I COULD NO LONGER EAT THE COOKIES, THE OFFICE ATE ALL MY COOKIES!  THEY WANTED MORE.  I DIRECTED THEM TO AMAZON.COM.  THE LADIES IN THE OFFICE HAD NO IDEA, GLUTEN FREE COOKIES TASTED SO GOOD.  THEY HAVE ALSO EATEN MY CHOCOLATE CHIP, GINGERSNAPS, SHORTBREAD COOKIES TOO.  SO THESE COOKIES APPEAL TO EVERYONE!
209	4	these are good, not like the baked lays that are made with processed potato flakes.
210	4	I like this product. It is slightly sweet for my taste though. It lacks instructions on the bottle for a single serving. Unless you intend on making the several quarts at a time it describes. Their website has the recipe for single servings which is helpful but why not have both on the bottle?? I prefer the other brand (J. Wilbur) which Amazon also sells. I think if you like this you will love J. Wilbur.
211	5	The Coffee People Bold Black Tiger Dark Roast is by far the best K-Cup I have tried.  I have had my Keurig brewer for about a year now and I have bounced around from brand to brand sampling the different coffees to find one that really speaks to me.  The Black Tiger may be that coffee.  I like a strong cup of coffee, but I don't want it to be bitter or taste burned.  The Black Tiger has no bitterness or over-roasted taste to it.  It is very smooth and full bodied.  I have also tried the Timothy's Rainforest Espresso and this coffee is far superior in texture, body, flavor, and strength.  I keep 3-4 different types of K-Cups near my brewer and ever since I bought the Black Tiger it is the only coffee I have drank!
212	5	My husband Loves this coffee he says to so smooth.  He loves the extra zing it give him in the morning.
213	5	The almonds tastes all right. Since it is too dry, the salt can hardly stay on surface. Therefore, it is not salty enough. On the whole, it is a healthy snack. I hope this type of almonds can have subscription service and discount.
214	5	Others probably just got unlucky, but the container I received had a large variety. Also, I got these late December, and we are just now getting close to finishing them (we being my brother and I). It's quite a lot, which is awesome. =)<br /><br />As you can expect, warheads are pretty sour, but sweet shortly after, and have good taste (also, I love the yellow ones =o)
215	5	This is the best low-carb cold cereal on the market.  Most of them taste like the cardboard box, but this one is actually crunchy and flavorful.
216	5	This tea is absolutely delicious.  I have it as a dessert and it is so satisfying.  The price is very high - I buy this at health food stores for $7.99.  I was hoping to find a better deal on Amazon.
217	5	This is the absolute best Barbque sauce and the only one I buy and use.  The big problem, it is very very difficult to find.  I live in the Phila area, a huge metropolis and no stores, NONE, carry it.  Thank goodness , I can buy it on Amazon.  I used to drive down to Claymont Delaware to buy it at Food Lion, but now they don't even carry it.  People , wake up, buy it and use it, it's the BEST!
218	5	Wow, I did a lot of reading trying to make a good decision on a K-cup hot chocolate, and of course taste is something that is very subjective.  If you read all the reviews on every product you'll discover that nothing gets past everyone and maintains a perfectly spotless reputation.  So I decided that even with some bad reviews I'd try this one since it has a lot of good reviews.  I'm just going to say that there are some real hot chocolate connoisseurs writing reviews in this thread.  Some discerning reviewers say it has a slight taste of sugar substitute, or some such thing.  All I can tell you is I must have under-achieving taste buds because all I can taste is yummy hot chocolate.  My family burned through the first box and I just ordered two more.  If you don't like this I feel sorry for you. Better to have numb taste buds I guess.  Enjoy.
219	5	I've tried several brands of catnip; this is definitely my cats' favorite. They go crazy over it.  I put this on their scratching post and they go nuts over it.  Thanks to this stuff, they now use their scratching post instead of my furniture.<br />A little of it goes a long way; you don't have to use a lot.
220	5	The sprouts grow nice and taste very good. I both two bottles to try them out and I'm happy I did.
221	5	I have 2 super-picky older cats (13 & 9).  I've tried so many options, but this is the first one where the CLEAN the bowl.  I've tried every flavor of Weruva on them, and the plain chicken is by far their favorite.  They like the other chicken varieties but for some reason there are peas, carrots, and pumpkin in it, all of which they strategically eat around.  They both can't stand fish, so chicken it is!<br /><br />Being meat and gravy in it's almost purest form, it definitely has a positive impact on their health.  Their fur is shinier and softer.  And they seem more happy and playful.<br /><br />I never used to believe a food upgrade could make such a difference, but this certainly did!!
222	5	I tried Licorice spice at a B and B in Maine and absolutely loved it.  I can't always find it at a kitchen or grocery store so Amazon came to my rescue.  I now purchase a case at a time.  The clove and licorice flavors are wonderful and very soothing.  Very nice to have at Christmas time!
223	5	These are great chips, low in fat, high in potassium. When I had difficulty finding them in Publix, I cheched out Amazon.com. Happy that I did. Not only is it more convenient, but less expensive, also!
224	5	Perfect sugar free treat for our family because we have a diabetic family member.  We watch our diet closely, but we do add this treat once in a while.
225	4	I'm still not a food reviewer. The problem is that I can't turn down free coffee. That said, this is good stuff, mellow with none of the bitter edge common with a lot of the cheaper stuff sold at the local grocery store. I subtracted one star from the review because of the ridiculously pretentious ad copy on the box. Drinking this coffee won't fix the world or make your life more fulfilling, I'm fairly sure.
226	5	I add a small amount of millet to the homemade cat food recipe I make each week.  This brand is excellent, and the seller ships quickly.
227	5	My dogs learned to use this machine in 5 days. We take it on our therapy dog visits to nursing home, hospitals,etc. & everyone ask if we have it along. The dogs go wild when they see me pack this for our visits. Your dog will learn to use his mind & gain co-ordination to get the food.<br />This was money very well spent.<br />Misty Meadows
228	4	The expensive Silver Needles White Tea comes from the Fujian region of China and has a very light and kind of grassy flavor.  If that's what you're looking for, this Tao of Tea product is not that.  According to the label it comes from the Hunan region of China and has a "roasted chestnut and wild honey aroma".  It costs less but the taste is definitely different.  If you've acquired a taste for the light/grassy flavor of Fujian White Tea, have a look at several other vendors that do carry that.<br /><br />If your drinking White tea mainly for health reasons, I don't know if one is any better than the other.  The flavor of this tea is nice and its organic so I'll continue to buy it, not as a replacement but as a supplement to the Fujian variety.
229	5	Seriously, this stuff is AWESOME! I literally could eat this by the spoonful straight out of the container!! Best thing since Reese cups!
230	5	DVD arrived in a very timely manner, packaging was good, and they were inexpensive.  I would definitely buy from this seller again.
231	5	I have tried quite a few brands and types of kibble but none work as well in helping my Bichon to avoid skin problems, particularly itchiness, as this one does.  It helps that she really enjoys the taste too.<br /><br />Update: January 2012:<br /><br />Wellness Simple Solution Rice and Salmon is the only kibble that I feed to my bichon.  She loves it and I love the way it helps with her allergies plus the fact that she never has any digestion problems.  I use to buy the smaller bags because I was concerned about freshness.  Before finding this on Amazon, I had to special order it at a local pet specialty store and very often the packages had short time frame expiration dates.<br /><br />After seeing how good the dates were on the smaller packages that I bought from Amazon, I switched to the larger 10 lb,8 oz. bag.  I have been absolutely delighted by the freshness.  The bag that I ordered in early January 2012, arrived nicely packaged and with an expiration date of July, 2012.<br /><br />I'm happy that not only am I getting a wonderful food, made in the USA, but I can count on getting a fresh shipment too.
232	5	This is a really superior cheese. slightly sharp with a nice saltiness and an excellent rosemary and olive oil rub.  Definitely worth looking for!
233	5	Title says it all. I first tried these crackers on a whim years ago when the packaging caught my eye in the local supermarket, and they've been my go-to cracker ever since. The bakers are able to ride that fine line of producing a cracker that almost looks homemade with minimal ingredients, but yet is impeccably consistent - I've never had a bad (broken, burnt, stale, broken seal, too many/few seeds, etc) batch. The flavor is mild, but distinctly sesame. For me, few things are better than this cracker topped with slices of brie cheese. With the packaging opened, the crackers last a couple weeks in the refrigerator.<br /><br />I feel like a lot of love goes into this product, and I certainly appreciate it.
234	5	This product and CAT SIP are both really great for any kitty that is underweight due to kidney failure or anything else that has left your kitty not eating or drinking enough.  It's also a nice treat for any kitty but be careful not to give too much at a time or too frequently.
235	5	Sampled these at Costco and immediately was hooked! 2lbs for $9.39 a bit pricey but definitely yummy! Wouldn't pay anymore than that for these and will only be a treat once in a while.
236	5	I have a friend who is a dandelion warrior.  Everytime she see's one, she pounces and that plant is history.  As a little joke, I ordered and sent her the tea.  To my surprise, she reported that she actually liked it, mentioning it had a rather nice smooth flavor.  Although that has not stopped her from still being a dandelion ninja, I give it 5 start just knowing that if she liked it - it HAS to be good!
237	4	I bought these for the health benifits, but they did not work so well in tea for me. Instead I put a heaping scoop in with my coffee grounds everymorning and it adds a very subtle fruit flavoring to my coffee. Everyone that tries it loves it.
238	4	These are good tomatoes without citric acid in them.  I'm surprised they increased the subscribe and save price by over 4.00 since I bought them 2 months ago; I've noticed price increases on just about everything I buy on a regular basis.  Inflation sure is happening fast!<br /><br />"Imported: Parent company is Mangia Inc., located in the Campania region with US offices in Mission Vejo, CA. In the US, offers "Italian Peeled," and San Marzano, but no DOP version. "At our production facilities in the San Marzano region, we have decided to produce Carmelina `e...

We can pass on the savings to our customers..."<br />http://www.sanmarzanotomatoes.org/canned-brands.html
239	3	I give it a 3 star just because of the price!!! (trust me its best noodles ever but way too expensive!!!) Awesome product no doubt but this will be the last time i will purchase it from this site. Thank goodness i just discovered a place to get it for HALF the Price... smh  @ veryasia
240	5	I'm not much of a dark chocolate eater, yet most milk chocolate tastes generic, so I tend to stay away from chocolate altogether. The thing that interested me in this chocolate was the 41% cacao because I don't ever see milk chocolate with a percentage (then again I don't usually pay attention). I gave it a try and was surprised that I actually really like it. At first it tasted kind of like dark chocolate but it wasn't bitter or too strong. Before I knew it my first bar was gone and I was on to the next! It is definitely not your average milk chocolate and there is nothing generic about the taste. The almonds were good as well, and as others mentioned you won't actually taste any sea salt. I think I will include this chocolate in my brothers' gift baskets for Christmas. I usually just throw in any fancy looking dark chocolate.
241	3	Pretty good as far as these things go, but I don't know, all the Tassimo milks have a kind of funny taste to me.
242	5	I ordered this on the first week of December and they said my package would come in on the 24th of December. It came in about 2 weeks early! I used it the first time on Christmas day and it worked great. I use it at least once a day and its been working great so far. Very easy instructions for setting it up and it brews my coffee very quickly. Thanks.
243	5	We use this for our dogs digestive system. We can't find it locally. It is a great product and our dogs love it.
244	5	These beans are a staple at our house.  I think I've tried every refried bean on the market.  This brand is consistently delicious.  We all love these beans in burritos, dips, taco salads, and more.  The refried black beans are also great.
245	4	This is an outstanding spice and I use it a lot. You can buy this from an Indian grocery store for $1.47 for 100 gm and $5.99 for 500 grams. All these MDH spices are too expensive at Amazon.
246	3	While it makes good bread, I've been very disappointed with it due to every single box that I've opened to date (4 boxes so far) having its plastic packaging inside not sealed along the vertical seam. Apparently the adhesive used to seal the plastic bag containing the mix didn't hold, or if heat was used to seal the seam, that technique didn't work either.
247	3	The movie style flavor is there, but the popped kernels are a bit chewy. It could be that I made it wrong by using a machine instead of the "Whirely Pop" thingy.
248	4	I ordered this because I was looking for something to replace Millstone Foglifter after the price got so outrageous.  Wile not quit as rich it fit the bill will reorder
249	5	This product from Earth's best is great! (as well as others from this brand)<br />I would like to mention that I like the fact that the cereal is packaged into a carton box. What could be better, safer and healthier? I wouldn't want the cerial my baby eats to see packaged in something else (and get into contact with that "something else"). Maybe it's not as convenient (as the previous reviewer mentioned,though the question of conveniency is arguable) but piece of mind and health of my baby surely makes it worth to deal with the packaging!
250	5	or really my dog loves them.  When I have a busy day and I am too tired to brush her teeth, I just give her one of these instead and they do as they describe:  keep her teeth clean.  They are very soft and easy on her teeth but also rub the leftovers off to keep them clean.  I really recommend these to anybody who has a dog and they also make cat greenies which also work for my barn cats and they love them.
251	5	Yes, our golden retriever will eat just about anything, but there are only a few treats that work to get him to rollover, go to his crate, do what he's told, etc. - these do the trick!
252	1	We were disappointed with this coffee. It didn't have the same quality or essence of blueberry that I have experienced in a Colorado blueberry coffee that I've tasted that unfortunately is no longer available. I will keep searching for a replacement
253	4	I was looking for a suitable substitute for my favorite k-cup coffee which was no longer available (Green Mountain Organic Espresso).  Jet Fuel appeared by its description to be a possibility.  Delivery was prompt and the price for 60-cups was competitive (much less expensive than the Green Mountain Espresso).  It is indeed a robust smooth tasting coffee, although not a "suitable substitute" for the Green Mountain Espresso.  I am enjoying the Jet Fuel, but will continue to look for an Espresso k-cup.  I hope Coffee-People will do something about replacing the Green Mountain Espresso favorite with an Espresso of its own.
254	5	This is a stable for my wife. She has a medical condition which requires frequent snacks and she cannot eat white flour. The WASA Light Rye is her favorite and we were delighted to find it on Amazon at an incredible price. Sadly, when it came time to re-order, it appears that Amazon does not carry it any more.
255	5	Great sea salt!  You don't have to use very much, just a pinch to obtain great results & great taste.  Recommend highly, if you haven't tried it...please do so.
256	5	All you need is a regular bottle of spring water or whatever you want to use, in goes the powder and voila, instant iced tea drink (well, instant in that you have to shake it first). The flavor (mango pineapple in this case) is very tasty and refreshing. Powdered drink mixes in this form aren't exactly a new found invention but if it tastes as good as this does, I have no problems recommending it to anyone. It's perfect for storing in your desk at work, taking it on the go or in just about any manner you can think of.
257	5	I first had Popchips last week at a local deli in Miami. I was so impressed with them that I came online to find them (not even remembering the brand name) and I'm so happy that my favorite online retailer Amazon offers them. I don't necessarily want $20 worth of chips (LOL) but on the other hand, I love them so much that I do need that many so I can have half at home, and half at work (in different flavors). And I'm sure this price is much cheaper than buying them one by one at the deli I go to.<br /><br />I am a serious chip lover but am always looking for healthier alternatives. I love that these chips are low in calorie/fat but taste 10X better than baked chips. There's something about a need for salt n crunch that baked chips don't solve for me. I've found most of them to be bland, flat, weird, cracker-like. As soon as you put one of these chips in your mouth you'll realize that they're not lightweights at all. I love the salt/vinegar and was very surprised that they don't lack flavor or taste less salty/vinegar(y) than their high calorie counterparts. The crunch of the chip reminds me of a ligther alternative to a kettle chip or the General Mills chips, Bugle. I am such a fan, and now that I've found these chips on Amazon, I don't plan to buy any other kind.
258	5	I have four cats with differing tastebuds/likes.  They all enjoyed this product, and there was no waste.  The supplier sent the wrong size, the smaller 3-ounce cans, but Amazon immediately rectified this in a highly satisfactory manner.  I use the recurring order option for an additional discount, and there is no tax levied on this product (like in stores) on Amazon's site.  I would recommend this product for anyone considering it for their cat(s)
259	5	The product arrived as promised in good condition. What can one say about sugar? My UPS delivery person had to have help getting it off her truck because of the weight. With a little help from my brother we solved the issue. It is now in my pantry awaiting use. If you like to stock up on frequently used food items then definitely use this product. With Amazon Prime I didn't have to pay for shipping either. Otherwise it would have cost prohibitive to do so.
260	5	We use lots of pepper.........love the coarse ground.  The size lasts alot longer than the small bottles found at the store........in the long run you save money!!
261	5	This is so wonderful that I have to put it on the saver program with Amazon.  I use this for everything, from cooking to putting it on right after the shower to putting it in mine and my children's hair before I condition wash our hair.  I even put it in my Chai tea and it's wonderful on toast, infact it's so great that I don't need any other type of spread like mayo or anything, it's absolutely delicious.  My youngest doesn't like the smell but what does she know, she's only 9, everyone else in the house loves it.  My first jar lasted about a month, but I had to split some of it up so I'd have some in the bathroom and the rest in the kitchen.  I like that it doesn't liquify until you put in on your skin, it only liquified once(it was over 75 degress where I had it) and I put in the frig, however; when I took it out it was too hard.  You'll be very happy when you purchase this and needless to say it came very quickly, I'm on the prime membership so I rec'd it in 2 days.  I love it so much that I'm having a fit because I ran out. Just another note for this (3/12) this stuff cleared up my eczema, I mean it's gone and my skin glows.
262	5	Very filling but not too oily, like other instant noodles out there. The noodles are just chewy enough and the right size for the hot, spicy soup. A fantastic quick meal for a chilling winter night.
263	5	I mix this soft food with my Boston Terrier's dry food, so I don't use much for each meal. Using the larger cans meant I would end up throwing half a can away.<br /><br />Wellness brand is very high quality food, and has been working very well for our dog who has a very sensitive stomach.
264	5	This stuff works wonders on head lice.  It works far better than any poison product we tried.  It killed the bugs and it dislodged the eggs.
265	5	These purees are great first foods for babies. They are easy to swallow and easy to digest, and it's gluten free, contains no dairy, no eggs, no nuts, no fillers, sweeteners or salt.  It was even enjoyed by one fussy baby who is particular about what it likes to eat.<br /><br />The packaging is perfect for travel; it's easy to open and dispense. The food is both tasty and nutritious. No refrigeration required unless opened. We think it's the perfect food to take along for babies when traveling or visiting. TRY IT.
266	5	Dr Becker has a taste like Mr Pibb, but a bit better - a little closer to Dr Pepper. I first tried this one at a health food store in Jacksboro, TX. One great thing about it is that Dr Becker is sugar, not corn syrup. I recommend this one.
267	5	This stuff is HOT but has a great flavor.  I am a hot sauce collector and have over 250 different hot sauces.  This is my absolute favorite.
268	5	I have been buying these for awile now for my older golden retriever for two reasons; the glucosamine in them and something less fattening and better tasteing than milk bones.  He just loves these.  They look good and smell good.  As soon as I open the package, he is there waiting.  He seems more active and I am hoping with the glucosamine in these and other glucosamine supplements I give him it helps his arthritis.  Amazon has good prices on these and with ther occasional promotions and free shipping their price can't be beat.
269	5	Too strong for me, but wife loves it and won't drink anything else except in an emergency.
270	5	These treats are the perfect size for training, and my pugs love them.  I don't think they are expensive at all, so I don't know why the previous reviewer gave these only one star.  The treats are about a centimeter in diameter, so you can give your pet many of these before they constitute an actual "treat" portion.  You won't regret buying these if you have a puppy who needs positive reinforcement.
271	5	I have been a fan of Orgain for over a year now. I recently subscribed-and-saved so I get a shipment of the Vanilla Bean flavor monthly. I have delayed gastric emptying and the Orgain drinks are helpful on bad days. They are way better all around than the alternatives for meal replacement drinks. I recently had an unexpected quality issue with the most recent carton she received, so I contacted Orgain about the problem. They replied promptly, offered a replacement, and followed up thoroughly. The quality of customer service I received was great--you don't get that very often. The company really seems to care about putting a quality product out there and keeping their customers happy. Orgain: Keep up the good work. Amazon: Keep offering good deals on this awesome product. Everyone else: Try Orgain, you'll be glad you did.
272	5	Fiber One has been a part of my multi-faceted, health-conscious lifestyle for years. Just like Cherrios, it can also serve as a bit-by-bit snack during a football game or movie. Sure, it takes some getting used to, but it's far healthier than the butter-laden, artery-clogging popcorn of my youth.  The only problem I have is that, just this week, Amazon.Com cancelled my subscription to both Fiber One and the big boxes of Cherrios.  I guess there are not enough fanatical health nuts like me to make it worth their while to stock these items.  So, it is back to the big-box, whole-sale warehouses.
273	1	These are the worst tasting cracklins( next to Dixon)..I made a mistake and bought 3 bags, yea what an idiot!! I know.dissapointed
274	5	We love this orange and actually prefer it to store or name brand orange soda.  It has a nice, bright orange taste with a tart finish and is our favorite flavor of all the mixes.
275	4	I've finished drinking 2 of the 6 boxes of Lavender Tulsi Herbal tea. I like this herbal tea as I enjoy the taste of lavender and am glad that the lavender is mixed with another herb as straight lavender can taste quite strong. I'm not sure I like the flavor of tulsi, but I guess it isn't so bad mixed in with the lavender.
276	5	Tasty treat for picky toddler with egg, milk, wheat, tree nut and peanut allergies.<br />Aside from Enjoy Life brand, there aren't many companies that have products like this.<br />It may contain soy, so check the ingredient listing if that's a sensitivity.<br />Texture and taste is like a classic store bought sugar cookie, with hints of cinnamon.
277	5	This is 2.5 oz larger than what you can find in pet stores and less expensive. Shipped day the it was ordered and arrived 2 days later with prime.
278	1	I tried writing a review previously but I focused on how recieving a bottle w a busted cap and dents on my product didnt make me super happy. I wasnt going to have a container once I took off the foil cause the cap was busted...so I got a plastic container and dumped syrup in there for storage. Tonight,  I made a mint julep w the syrup. Its wasnt a HORRIBLE drink, but its not a mint julep to me. It just didnt taste like the ones Ive had. Taste combined w a shabby bottle didnt work for me.
279	5	Great tasting coffee. Through Subscribe and Save,there is no reminding to order it. Why order it through Amazon? It is there when you need it and at a lower price than in grocery stores.Plus the ordering process is seamless and so easy.Customer service is flawless.
280	4	This is a nice Earl Grey, nothing surprising about it. Good flavor but not overpowering. Easy to drink several cups at a time.
281	5	i wrapped the pill--our vet said to put them in food...but BOTH of our cats inhaled them without food.  i'd use them as plain old treats...way better than trying to 'pill' your cat.  AWESOME, highly recommend
282	5	I previously tried other matcha products and was generally satisfied with the quality but not the price.  I decided to give Pure Matcha green and rooibos a try because the price seemed to be very competitive.  The quality of Pure Matcha's products surpasses that of all others I have tried- stays fresh, has a consistent texture and tastes great.  Both the quality and price are better than others that I have purchased for the same quantity.  I highly recommend Pure Matcha and will continue to purchase.
283	5	My background is 50 years of dog/cat owner and college degree in chemistry so I'm not completely ignorant about pet nutrition. After a few days of Google research and reading pet food negatives and positives, I decided on a mix of Wellness both wet and the dry exclusively for my two rescue/shelter kitties based on reviews and availability. Price was not a deciding factor. After 1-1/2 years, they still gobble it down and I'm pleased to report both kitties mental and physical health to be outstanding with shiney, smooth coats, regular bowel movements, and healthy, energetic activity. I contribute this good fortune mostly to their diet of Wellness and a loving home environment although my billfold wouldn't mind if it were a bit cheaper. In my experience, Wellness has been outstanding.
284	5	OK, so you know how you buy those wonderful-looking tortellini in the deli-case, sure they'll make a wonderful meal this week, except, well, life happens, and by 2 weeks from now you haven't even gotten around to them and have to throw them out?<br /><br />Thanks to the three reviewers here who actually reviewed the product, not just an ordering mix-up, we gambled and bought a whole case of these, sight unseen (later we found them at our local supermarket, same size, same brand, but higher price).<br /><br />Turns out, they're delicious!  My very picky husband raved about them two nights ago.  And we both love the fact that we have a luscious, simple meal on hand -- IN THE PANTRY!  No more crowding of the refrigerator, no more throwing out expired delicacies.<br /><br />If you ever stop to eat on the way home from work because you're too tired to cook anything complicated and you're not sure what's still fresh in the fridge, hurry:  order yourself up a case of these, and I'll bet you'll have that problem solved twice a week!<br /><br />Tip:  for a gourmet, restaurant-quality sauce that's even faster and that, like this, stays in the pantry until you need it, try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012HP1CC">Bertolli Premium Pasta Sauce, Summer Crushed Tomato & Basil, 13.5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)</a> -- microwaves in its own pouch in 90 seconds.  NINETY SECONDS!  NO POT!  Tastes "10 times better than the fresh tomato sauce in the deli case", says my husband.  Makes the tortellini into a gourmet dish too.<br /><br />Bet you didn't know you could put a gourmet dinner on the table in less than 20 minutes with only 1 pot -- the one to boil the pasta!  :)  And at only a little over $4 for two of you (no, both the pasta and sauce say they feed 3 people, and they both exaggerate -- count on 2), it's still a steal.  Compared to what you would have spent at the cheapest fast-food or take-out place?  And with only 1 pot (use one with a strainer built in, like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E5BIDE">Cuisinart Chef's Classic Stainless 3-Quart Cook and Pour Saucepan with Cover</a>, so you don't even have to use a separate strainer!) plus 2 bowls plus 2 large spoons to wash, well, I don't think it gets much better than this!  :)
285	1	I read a review that stated that these taste like the inside of a peanut butter cup, only a little sweeter. They do not. They have the consistency of what you would find in a peanut butter cup, but not the taste. Another reviewer said these taste just like Mexican wedding cake cookies. This is actually the review that sold me on getting these. They do not taste like that either. I think the consistency is what sold these reviewers on the response that they give. I will admit that the consistency is fun, it's crumbly, and makes it seem more appealing, the flavor is in no way appealing to me.<br /><br />What these do taste like is a mix between powdered sugar and the faintest hint of peanut butter. The powdered sugar overwhelms this product and is not appealing to my taste buds. If you like eating powdered sugar than you will probably enjoy these. I am sure there is a market out there for these confections, I just would not purchase these again, nor can I recommend them.
286	2	Like the other 2 reviewers, my son (13 months) is not picky! I actually call him my "champion", cause he has never refused any food...except this! The smell of garlic was the first thing I noticed when I opened the pouch, but I thought I'd give it a try anyway. Yeah, nope! I did get him to eat it, cause like I said, he's a champ...but it took FOREVER!! Then I put him down for a nap, and when I went in to get him, his whole room REEKED of garlic! The garlic was so strong, even his poop smelled like garlic! Thats when I knew we wouldnt be trying that one again!<br /><br />I gave it 2 stars because he did eventually eat the entire pouch, and we love all the other recipes...but this one needs some adjustments!
287	3	This water is pretty good, but not great. At the time I got it, it was the most economical water that shipped free with Prime, so if they keep that up, it will be a great deal for a lot of people.<br /><br />I might be tainted, because I was just up in Washington, where this water is from, and almost all of the bottled water I got up there, plus the tap water, was better than this. But, I love Washington water, so I'm probably judging it too harshly<br /><br />It's not bad, and it does have a unique water taste, so I'm sure this will be someone's absolute favorite water. No one will hate this water.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+This is good water<br />+Has a unique taste<br />+Everyone will like it, but not a lot of people will ask for more<br /><br />Cons:<br />-I expect more from Washington water than this
288	4	If you like coffee but can not stop to get some these coffee flavored candies are just right, a bit hard to unwrap but hits the spot.
289	5	Our cat is 6-years-old and has eaten (voraciously) the same brand of food in both the chow and the canned variety for all of his life.  He's not at all a picky eater (even given to nabbing a potato chip if he can).<br /> Nonetheless, we were a bit reluctant to try a new brand of food but no worries there.  With his first can of the Petit Cuisine Chicken Pie we knew we'd found a winner.  He didn't hesitate for a second, not even the unfamiliar smell slowed him down.  He seemed to particularly enjoy the liquid, lapping every bit of it.  A full tummy, a grateful rub of my shin,  and he slept for a few hours.  What a life!<br /> Five purrs for Petite Cuisine!
290	5	I would never guess that these pretzels were gluten free if I had not read the label.
291	5	Love them they are great but the packaging drives me nuts<br />cannot get into them without scissors
292	5	Excellent hot drink.  It tastes a little like Postum, and without any caffeine.  I would certainly recommend it highly for an alternate for coffee.
293	4	We have been through 3 brands of dog food over the past 3 years because of price/availability on Amazon.  This is the last (Amazon delivered) brand we tried because our regular brand became unavailable.<br /><br />The Premium Edge Salmon seems to have a quality list of ingredients & seems comparable to the Costco Salmon brand (Costco is slightly cheaper but Costco requires an annual membership fee & Amazon delivers to your doorstep).  The food does have an odor that we didn't find in our other premium foods, and I do not know the source of the odor (we previously have feed our dogs <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCWAFY">Castor & Pollux Ultramix Large Breed Adult Canine Formula Dry Dog Food, 30-Pound Bag</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NZPFB0">Dogswell Happy Hips for Dogs, Chicken & Oats Dry Dog Food, 22.5-Pound Bag</a>.<br /><br />The dogs do not seem to mind the odor & happily chow down on this food (they are slightly picky and, when I was in a food pinch, turned their noses up at Iams).  Their stools are firm & their coats are good & healthy.<br /><br />Because we go through so much dog food (120lbs/month), and because of availability issues that I've had with Amazon in the past, we will be switching to the Costco/Kirkland food.  However, if this is less of a concern for you & if you want your dog food delivered to your doorstep (a real plus), then this is a premium food that is worth trying. Both this brand & the Costco brand is manufactured by Diamond Pet Foods, a company that has had a lot of recalls in the past (in fact, both this food & the Costco food were subject to recall in early 2012).
294	5	As another reviewer noted...This is like crack for dogs! My dog likes jerky but loves freeze dried liver. The tub may be a but much but is the best value.
295	3	the cookies are good.<br /><br />my only 'complaint' is that almost every package i have opened has had broken cookies in it.  it's really no big thing, just a little annoying to have to watch all the time to be sure you don't drop a piece.  otherwise the cookies themselves are fine.
296	5	Maxwell House Coffee T-Disks provide a superb cup of coffee...as good as it gets.  The ease and convenience of the Tassimo Brewer and the t-disks make a cup of coffee you can enjoy at home... just like you used to have to go to the coffeeshops to enjoy.
297	4	My cat happily scarfed down some of these.<br /><br />These cat dental treats appear to be different than others.  DentaShield coats the the teeth to block tarter formation.<br /><br />The directions say to feed the cat 4-5 of these twice a day.  I'm guessing this little pouch to be about 2 weeks worth at that rate.<br /><br />Corn flour is the first ingredient, not really the best stuff for your cat but corn is often a major ingredient in catfood anyway.  As a treat, its probably okay, but these would be better labeled corn & chicken treats than salmon treats.  Having said that, the cat doesn't really appear to care (he can't read).  Appears to be a nutritional supplement as well as a dental treat.  Wish there was some way to know what the RDA of this stuff is for cats.<br /><br />The ingredients:  Corn flour, chicken meal, wheat flour, corn gluten meal, poultry fat, dehulled soybean meal, salmon meal, sodium hexametaphosphate, poultry digest [what is that??], dried brewers yeast, calcium carbonate, potassium chloride, salt, choline, chloride, lecithen, vitamin E supplement, niacin supplement, vitamin A supplement, calcium pantothenate, vitamin B12 supplement, riboflavin supplement, biotin, thiamin mononitrate, folic acid, pyridoxine hydrochloride, vitamin D3 supplement, menodione sodium bisulfite complex, ferrus sulfate, zinc oxide, manganese oxide, copper sulfate, cobalt carbonate, ethylenediamine dihydriodide, sodium selenite, mineral oil, dl-methionine, taurine, color added (titanium dioxide, yellow #6, blue #1), BHA (a preservative), mixed tocopherols (a preservative).<br /><br />Guaranteed analysis:<br />Crude Protein min: 25%<br />Crude Fat min: 8%<br />Crude Fiber max: 4%<br />Moisture max: 10%<br />Vitamin A 2,273 IU/lb<br />Vitamin E 14 IU/lb<br />Zinc 75 mg/kg<br />Selenium .1 mg/kg<br />Taurine. .1%<br /><br />Calorie Count 1.1 per treat
298	5	The Green Mountain Extra Bold Dark Magic decaf is a very good, strong coffee. It does have a slight bite, but then I like that in a coffee. Many decaf coffees have little to no taste, especially using K cups, but this decaf actually tastes like coffee! For those interested, the caffeinated version of the Dark Magic coffee is great too! That is why I ordered the decaf to try. I highly recommend that you give it a try.
299	5	The only kind of chews my Jack Russell Terrier will have anything to do with!
300	5	I like sweet potato fries, and so I wanted to try these chips.  They're spicey, and if you like a spicey chip, then you should try these.  I like spicey foods, but I was a little disappointed in not being able to really taste the sweet potato.  This chip was given a high rating by CENTER FOR SCIENCE IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST'S Nutrition Action Newsletter.  I'm going to try the plain sweet potato chips.  I give ten stars to Amazon's packaging.  With packaging and fast delivery, who needs to go to the grocery store for chips?
301	5	my son loves these muffins.  he has them everyday for breakfast.  he has had celiac for 6 years and i am so grateful i can buy this product at amazon as it is very hard to purchase at the specialty food stores
302	5	I love this oatmeal. I cook up a big batch and warm it up daily for breakfast or even a mid-afternoon snack. I put one tablespoon of butter in a pan and add one cup of oats. Over medium heat, I stir the oats until I can begin to smell them then I add 3 cups of water and one cup of 1% milk with 1/2 tsp of kosher salt and then cook on low (covered) for 30 minutes,stirring occasionally. When I get my serving, I add brown sugar and fresh blueberries and then nuke it in the microwave for one minute. Usually I can't eat oatmeal because it aggravates my IBS but the steel cut oats have actually helped me out a lot! They taste wonderful and have a very pleasant chewy texture.
303	5	Seriously, so easy to make, all natural ingredients and the cutest box.  Perfect for a gift basket or hostess/teacher gift!
304	3	I bought the Lemon-flavored mints before and was quite pleased. Decided to try this gum and was looking forward to a similar experience (read somewhere that cinnamon is good for your breath). You live and learn. I've found out that I am one of the few (or many?) people who have an allergic reaction to cinnamon. It was fine at first but after about a week of using the gum (three to four pieces daily), I developed tiny sores on my tongue and much bigger ones on the insides of my cheeks. Stopped taking the gum and it cleared up in about a week. Tried two pieces after it had mostly gone, and had a mild reaction within hours. Very disappointed, but it's not the product's fault really. Should've tried a smaller jar first, and probably should have googled "cinnamon allergy," due diligence is so important when parting with cash. Will have to give away the rest now.
305	4	I've eaten lots of pre-packaged pasta products over the years due to work schedules, etc. as it's often less expensive than eating out.  Generally I find most to have overcooked pasta and generally bland sauces.  Until now, I've not tried a Barilla product.<br /><br />This one was a bit different than others I've eaten in that the pasta is actually cooked al dente which was a pleasant surprise!  The sauce is bright and flavorful for a basic marinara type sauce and has a hint of basil.  In another surprise there were also a few chunks of tomato in the sauce.  The amount of sauce works perfectly for the amount of pasta with a portion size that is good for lunch.  Add a small side salad and and a piece or two of garlic bread and this could easily work as an evening meal.<br /><br />Preparation is quick and easy.  1 minute or so (may need longer in smaller microwave ovens) to a hot meal.  I appreciated the sauce being in a separate, removable, container in the package both for mixing with the pasta and the ability to heat it separately an additional few seconds if desired.  Frankly, this design is what keeps the pasta cooked properly as it's not sitting in the sauce on the shelf becoming softer with time.  Just be careful pulling that cover off as it's very well attached and if not removed with caution can easily create a lunch disaster with hot sauce covering everything.<br /><br />Yes, you could make your own for less money but it's comparable in price to competing, less flavorful, products and less expensive than similar dishes at corporate fast-food establishments.<br /><br />Overall a very tasty and convenient product for portable meal needs.
306	2	Purchased this product at Costco like the other reviewers.  I too hate buying packets at the outrageous price of $1+ per, so when I saw this for $4, I jumped.  Unfortunately, the flavor is quite bland, it's missing that certain something that distinguishes between tacos and "meat with some spices in it."  I checked the back of a McCormick packet, and not only do the directions differ, but the ingredients (and ingredient order) differ as well.  This isn't like buying the packets in bulk at all, it's like buying a completely different product.  I do like the McCormick packets, but even the generic store brand packets are better than this bottle, and my kids won't even eat the tacos I make with them.  Won't buy again.
307	3	These puff pops were very cute, but a little messy and not that great tasting. Great novelty item for a party though, people think it's pretty awesome!
308	5	You can't fine the Tully's Kona in the stores, because of a shortage of kona beans. At least that is the story I hear.
309	5	Tastes great, easy to use and lowers cholesterol.  We leave them sitting out on the counter so my husband can grab one easily.  It works great.
310	5	Tea arrived on time and is being enjoyed. That's about all I can say about it for now anyway. OK?
311	4	Tasty Bite has become my least favorite brand of shelf-stable retort-packaged Indian meals. The Bombay Potatoes are a pleasant surprise after some of the other meals such as the syrupy Thai entrees.  (The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E5DKLM">Tasty Bite Entree, Punjab Eggplant, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> is another one I like.)<br /><br />The potatoes and chickpeas have retained a sufficient amount of texture.  The sauce is thin but has a pleasant spiciness and there is plenty of it, which I don't mind because it is pretty good, especially compared to some of the other ones I have tried.  You can add leftover potato, chickpeas, or even green beans to this meal and I like to serve it with brown rice and garnish with diced chili peppers.<br /><br />The entire package is supposed to be two servings but is realistically one. The total contents have 820mg of sodium, 6g of dietary fiber, 8g of fat, and 1g of saturated fat. The meal is vegan and is certified kosher.
312	5	My cat will meow at me (more like a howl), demanding that I give him a pinch of his favorite snack food.  I give him just a pinch at a time.  One ounce will last me about a month.
313	4	This is a cute product to use in place of sprinkles - the bright colors of candy coating look great, and the chocolate center keeps them from being overly sweet.<br /><br />However this price is roughly double what you pay at Michael's (or Marshall's, when they stock stuff like this). Plus you can get the same product but in a 16 oz bag on Amazon here: http://www.amazon.com/CK-Products-Rainbow-Candy-Coated/dp/B00375LAO0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=home-garden&qid=1300131716&sr=1-1. Comes with Prime shipping too!
314	5	This will be a staple in my kindergarterner's lunch box. 100% fruit and tastes great.
315	5	I first got hooked on the plain version of these from Trader Joe's; from there, I found the Wasabi flavor at Whole Foods and what can I say: I'm completely ADDICTED!! These are light, flavorful sheets that pack a nice kick with the spicy flavor. These are indeed 'fishy' in taste - hence the SEAweed taste... you know, from the SEA?? But it's not a rancid taste or anything like that. If you don't like the taste of fish, these and other SEAweed products are probably are not for you, but if you enjoy a nice Asian-themed snack, these are PERFECT!! Ordering them on Amazon is definitely a savings over Whole Foods and so far - several orders later - I haven't had any problems with quality, cost or shipment.
316	5	Good service as shipment arrived shortly after ordering.  Good product, much more healthy for cats than most of the readily available foods.  And our cats really like this food.
317	2	I bought these cookies for myself and as a gift for my dad for his birthday. Unfortunately, 2 out of 4 of the boxes I gave my dad as a gift had mostly broken cookies, and were stale tasting. Not a great gift idea, and not really packaged or handled well. I have bought the delice cookies in the past and had no problems other than a random broken cookie in a box. I have not opened all of the boxes yet of course, but will hope to find a couple that are not all broken up to give to my dad.
318	5	I have enjoyed this tea for about fifeteen years. It was introduced to me by a tea shop owned by a Ms. Gray originally from London, England. She was a child there during the second world war. She was moved to the country side during the war because of the bombing of London. After thae war she moved to the United Staes settling in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I never questioned her about her reason to move here but suspect it was because of her marriage to an American soldier while he was in England. Ms. Gray and her daughter ran a tea shop in Bay View, an area on the south side of Milwakee. For a reason unknown to me she moved her business to Waukesha, a small city about twenty miles west of Miwaukee. Her new shop was located in the heart of Waukesha and drew many people. I moved to Waukesha in nineteen eighty and was introduced to the new shop by my wife. We then enjoyed breakfast there almost evey Saturday morning.<br /><br />My paternal grandmother was originally from London, having moved to Milwaukee at the age of seven, with her mother and her father, an engineer, who was sent to a new engineering office in Milwaukee by his employer in England in eighteen eighty two. She spoke to me at quite length about her childhood in England and Milwaukee. As a result I developed a kinship to the English people.<br /><br />One morning at the tea shop Ms. Gray sat down at my table and we discussed our past and other things. I then learned that Ms. Gray's grandfather had started the Gray's Pottery Company in England. My wife was a collector of English Children's Plates, epescially those from Gray's Pottery. We all became quite good friends, having a number of things in common.<br /><br />The tea Ms. Gray served as her "House Tea" was what she called Yorkshire Red, the very tea that I am speaking of here. It is a rather full bodied tea, often replacing coffee in many people's breakfasts. Taylors of Harrogate recommends the use of sugar and cream or milk in this coffee, the same way that I prefer it.<br /><br />The tea shop was closed in the late nineteen ninety due to the hard work required to make all the items the tea shop sold. These included skones and other baked items along with the breakfast staples served by Ms. Gray and her daughter. Yet Yorkshire Red remains my favorite beverage for breakfast. I have never lost my taste for it and probably never will. It has become an old friend of mine bringing back to me many fond memories. I suspect that you too will feel this way afer adding to your breakfast menu.<br /><br />Martin Ullstrup<br />Saint Francis, Wisconsin.
319	5	Updated review<br />--------------<br />I originally gave this a 4-star rating that I am now upgrading. I no longer have a concern about "oiliness." I have been getting this item on subscription for a year, and have compared it to the decaf expresso I get in the real world. For someone who drinks a lot of coffee, the subscription price is unbeatable. I have no clue as to why a few people gave this product one-star -- my guests (usually sophisticated coffee drinkers) love it and so do I. Maybe it's the type of expresso machine one has .....<br /><br />Old review<br />----------<br />Price was great. Crema, flavor, and aroma very good. Minor problem is that beans seem to have a bit of external oil, and they sometimes do not all slide down the shallow slope of my expresso maker.<br /><br />P.S. I signed up for monthly deliveries, and they arrive like clockwork (but also make it easy to skip a shipment!).
320	5	Package arrived DOUBLE boxed, wrapped, and the inside box(that holds the goods) perfect not a single dent or rough mark, outstanding packaging.<br /><br />The Product?<br /><br />These are the best chips on the planet, Salt 'N Vinegar flavor is beyond among the best chips I've ever had. You might, actually I'm sure you probably won't like it AT FIRST BITE 'IF' you have never had these before. But try it again.<br /><br />Not to mention, this particular flavor has held up in numerous surveys and comparisons against other manufactures.
321	5	This stuff tastes just like regular pasta and the elbow noodles can even be used in a pasta salad without getting all mushy.<br /><br />I don't normally use soy products, but this is made with GMO free soy and it is only part of the ingredients. I am willing to overlook the soy ingredient and eat it since the texture is almost identical & it tastes so much like wheat pasta.<br /><br />This is the best gluten free pasta! Thanks Bionaturae! ;o)
322	5	I bought the onion flavored crackers and they are delicious.  Very nutty flavor, with a hint of onion, crunchy, crispy and most importantly nutricious.  I love them.
323	5	I've tried the other teas but when I open the package of this tea the freshness comes out. The tea has a great peppermint flavor. If you're trying to diet then mix it with ginger root tea and it has a great flavor by themselves without adding the calories of sweeteners. It won't taste sweet but it will taste good. Drink it practically everyday.
324	5	My review is pretty much in the title. The coffee itself was fantastic. Great flavor and I highly recommend it for any coffee lovers out there.<br />The only trouble I had was in the shipping. One of the vacuum sealed bricks had been compromised with a slice in the side of it.<br />Nevertheless, the coffee was still useable in my opinion.
325	5	I'd have to say these Hot & Spicy Instant noodles are among some of the best out there.  Highly recommend trying some if you like spicy stuff and ramen noodles...
326	4	Online, this product looked like such a bad idea that I had to order it.  Honestly, what is salmon jerky?<br /><br />It turns out that salmon jerky is exactly what it sounds like.  Salty, chewy, boneless dried fish with a hint of garlic.  Although the flavor could have been more aggressively spicy (it didn't knock my socks off), this product is still extremely easy to eat.<br /><br />This is a great protein snack for before the gym.  Eating it makes you feel strong...like an Inuit hunter...
327	5	My daughter and I loved these when they first came out but had been unable to find them locally.  Then I thought, if anyone would have them, Amazon would!<br /><br />So glad to find them - it made a nice addition to her Christmas stocking.
328	5	I am so glad to find this soup on Amazon! I have searched for it in the stores since it disappeared several years ago. I'm not a big soup person, so you know it's good when I say wow, yum!
329	5	You can't buy Sweet Rice Flour this affordably in stores, and for the smooth texture it brings to gluten-free baking, it's worth investigating.  Blended with other supportive flours, sweet rice flour is likely the one gluten-free flour with a texture as smooth as traditional wheat-based baking.  It has a mild, sweet flavor, and Bob's Red Mill products are consistent and dependable.  Will buy again!
330	5	Wellness is a great cat food that my kitties just love. I chose this brand for its natural ingredients. Two of my cats have issues - one with diabetes and one with obesity. I needed a cat food that is grain free (for the fat kitty) and low carb (for the diabetic kitty). If you need a cat food that is not loaded with byproduct garbage, then Wellness is a great choice.
331	5	People used to the usual american burnt espresso (AKA starbucks) need to taste illy's coffee.  Also, the POD system works well to deliver consistency for those less inclined to fuss over their own grind-and-tamp.  The consistent quality of the espresso is high and together with the convenience, it's a winner for all but the snootiest (for whom, nothing but their own "recipe" will have been satisfactory anyway).
332	5	These are one of the few treats my dog loves that are not bad for him. It's like semi-healthy junk food for dogs. Alot of the other treats you have to be careful about. Some are made in China from sawdust and flavored with beef and chicken broth. Beware of ANYTHING mande in China. ANYTHING!!!  Do your homework before buying treats and other things for your pets!!!
333	1	This is the worst low-carb product I have ever purchased.  When using it to make pizza crust, I could not even cover half the pizza pan, and the taste was horrible.  I used it to make biscuits, and they were incredibly dry and had no flavor.  I tried again, adding some margarine, and they still tasted awful.  I tried to make pancakes, and the batter was as thick as cement.  I tried adding more liquid, but they were horrible.  I cannot imagine how this product is still on the market. Krusteaz used to make WONDERFUL low-carb baking products, so I know it can be done.  This stuff, however, is awful.
334	5	My 80 year old Mom suffered from excruciating back and muscle pain. When I took her to see an MD specializing in pain relief, he recommended she try using CALM first, stating many of his patients found significant pain relief by addressing their magnesium deficiency by taking CALM. After she successfully reduced the pain using CALM as part of the regimen prescribed by her MD, my husband and I started using CALM for our muscle and joint pains, (61 and 58) and also found relief from pain; we accidently discovered it promotes a good night's sleep when we missed taking it one night and did not sleep as well. All of us now use CALM daily and stockpile a 3 month supply!
335	4	This product is extremely good.  It is very sweet so only use a little until you know how you like it.  I put it in my iced tea.  The only problem I have is that the shipping cost more than the product.  I can't drive right now or I would have bought it at the grocery store.  That's why I only gave it 4 stars.
336	3	I would not recommend buying this product because of its large quantities and extremely sweet flavor. Caution: They may not be as healthy as they seem.<br /><br />When I first got these cereal bars I honestly thought they were delicious and great. I ate a couple every few days. It's true that this product would make a great snack or quick breakfast... but only for a short period of time. I soon got tired of these cereal bars and half of the box still exists (it was only me eating them).<br /><br />They are very very sweet and there's more of the sweet jam filling than the multigrain wrap. If you do not have much of a sweet tooth (like me) I do not recommend getting these. And if you really want them, buy the individual boxes in stores. They may be a bit more pricey if you count the individual cost, but you get more choices of flavors and there's only 8 bars per box so you wont end up with a ton left over when you finally get sick of them. And plus, leftover food is still money wasted.<br />Amazon has them but they only sell the boxes in 6 count packs like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AYFCHW">Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars, Cherry, 8-Count Bars (Pack of 6)</a> or the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E77LT6">Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars, Strawberry, 8-Count Bars (Pack of 6)</a> so you still get 48 bars.<br /><br />So I give this product 3 stars. It's okay, but not great. And they are 120 calories per bar.
337	5	These are great!  Excellent alternative to p**t****.  All time favorite flavor is the Brown Sugar Maple, but the pink frosting on the Wildberry ones make them a closer second runner-up.  Husband also really loves the chocolate ones ... they make a great sweet treat.
338	4	Good subtle flavored coffee for the mid-afternoon pick me up. A bit of sweetness without being overdone. Wish it was available in whole bean as I like it stronger then the Keurig cup can make it.
339	5	I first bought the Cherry Pistacio from Meijer and really liked it but when I went back for more they were sold out of that flavor. I then tried the Berry and the Apple and liked those too. I went to two other stores but haven't been able to find it anywhere else. I was happy to find them at Amazon and ordered a dozen in each flavor including the Peach.  I do have to say that at least for me, the cooking directions need tweaking.  I add more water and increase the microwave time or it doesn't seem to be cooked enough and is too thick. Having said that, I think they taste great.  They're not mushy and have lots of texture, not to mention the convenience of having it all in it's own bowl.  Great to take to work since I'm always on the run. It's true that the price is a bit more from Amazon but at least I can find it when I run out so I'm okay with that.
340	5	Its a really delicious earthy, herbal tea. Every cup makes me feel warm and comfy. I love it! his will definitely be a repeat order.
341	1	Just as in one of the previous reviews, my dog (wheaten terrier) had severe liquid diarrhea a few hours after eating the Rachel Ray Nutrish Soup Bone product.  He ran outside as quickly as possible to "go" and seemed very embarrassed and panicked. After the "explosions" and him trying to scoot all over the grass, he was drooling and panting more than normal and curled up in a ball at the bottom of the basement steps, after which, he went straight in his kennel. Poor thing! I normally feed my dog Go! and Now! all natural and/or grain free dog foods, made in Canada and sold at an independent pet supply shop. Apparently, they are well worth the price.  Never again will I make an impulse treat purchase on a rare trip to Wal-Mart. I hope he recovers quickly and allows me to clean his bottom. Eeek! I blame Oprah. I bet she wouldn't feed her cocker spaniels this crap!
342	4	I buy these dog treats for my cats and break them up to make them smaller.  All five of my rescued cats love them, but one regularly upchucks them after gulping them down.  Mostly his problemm, but I note he does not vomit other treats, so it's worth keeping an eye on the issue if you feed them.
343	5	I have a bengal striped cat who especially loves greenies. Recently, he got sinus trouble, so I got the Sinu-rite here at Amazon.  I needed something to get that free shipping, so I got the pill pockets.<br /><br />The pill pockets were made perfectly for those little pills: Just slip it in, mash the little doughy thing shut, and Barney Bengal swallows it up like he's never eaten in weeks. (That's how I first found him; he hadn't eaten in weeks.)<br /><br />They might be expensive, but they sure make giving pills to cats hassle free.
344	4	These treats are a daily ritual between me and my cats, they really love them.  The product arrives quickly, appears fresh and well packaged, and is priced reasonably - a good deal overall.
345	5	These were better than I could have ever hoped.  As far as the Weight Watcher plus points goes they are 3 pp.  There are a lot in a package and they are so worth the calories and/or the points.
346	4	KIND makes a good variety of these raw food bars. The Almond, Walnut, and Macadamia are very good and can be addictive. Nice crunch, good protein. Great snack that's easy to enjoy!
347	5	I really like this product. It is always fresh and taste great.  I especially like the lid which is easy to use and secure.  Not like other brands with a flip lid that tears easily and can leak.
348	4	I like STRONG coffee.  This is as close as I have found yet to the bold factor I love!
349	5	Kettle Chips are the best potato chip God has ever invented.  I give the Lord thanks every day for delivering unto me such an incredulously delicious blend of ginger and spice, a veritable cornucopia of flavor.  I have actually changed my diet to a strict regiment of the Spicy Thai & Sea Salt and Vinegar flavors, alternating days. I have already lost 5 lbs, not to mention the myriad of other health benefits I have been experiencing. Get your life back - with Kettle Chips.
350	5	This was delicious. I was hesitant about trying it, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was so delicious and soft. I like my cookies crunchy and well done. Lol When baking my own I usually lightly burn a few for me. But this cookie was so good. I think I will make an exception for the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisins
351	1	I recieved an email from the FDA stating that Keebler has placed a "precautionary hold" on these crackers because of the salmonella outbreak associated with peanut butter. You can look up the info on Keebler's website.
352	5	I decided to switch my cat's food because she was having all kinds of problems:  excessive throwing up, urinary tract issues, and significant weight loss that the vet couldn't explain.  I switched her from Kirkland dry and Friskies Turkey Pate canned to Wellness dry and Wellness chicken formula, and it's been almost an overnight miracle.  She's put on at least a pound in 3 weeks (she eats an entire 5.5 oz can plus dry food every day--no more pushing the food around and not really eating), no more straining on the litter box, and she hasn't barfed in over a week!  I'm really impressed at what a difference this food has made for my cat's health.
353	5	Fantastic Rice!  Don't let the price stop you from purcahsing this product.  Use a table spoon of vinegar to cook.
354	5	Tempo makes great swedish meatballs. I have used them for years and you can add different sauces to your finished meatballs. They are so moist, everyone raves over them. Sometimes I find them at the stores and sometimes they are out, so with Amazon, I always have them when I need them.<br />LC in PA
355	5	Our old dog has dental problems and arthritis.  She LOVES her Greenies and reminds us that she "deserves" one a day.  Since starting on her "senior" Greenies, she is much more limber and agile.  She has also started chewing on her chew sticks again (after several years of not being interested in them...and yes, we take her to the vet to have her teeth cleaned).
356	4	I did see coconut listed in the ingredients, but toward the end of the list.  However, it is heavily laden with coconut.  Just make sure you really like coconut before you buy this variety.
357	5	I am always willing to try new hair care products, always looking for something new and better. I got this for my him, and am quite pleased with the results. It comes out of the bottle nice and thick, and lathered up well in his hair. For the rest of the day his hair was nice and soft, with a good body. It was manageable, and smelled of nothing but clean.<br /><br />He has been using it continuously for several weeks now, and has not experienced any burning on the scalp, or itching, or anything untoward. He's quite satisfied with it, and I am pleased with the way that his hair looks when he uses it. As such it a two thumbs up recommendation!<br /><br />(Review of CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY AntiDandruff Shampoo, Clean & Refresh)
358	5	I got my bag from Costco and it was really good. I'm not sure how Amazon's version is but the coffee I got was very smooth and not at all acidic or sour as others complained. The batch must have been really fresh since the glass container I put it in would pop every time I opened it. When I roast coffee, this will occur from the gasses being released and expanding. Again, I got mine from Costco and from my guess, they take orders and have them filled directly from the company, so it was pretty fresh. The price was very decent for organic fair trade as well. Even for espressos, latte's and cap's, it's a very nice coffee. Highly recommend. Suggestion, don't over grind or drink after coffee has been sitting too long, it will get sour and/or bitter. Don't buy coffee that's been sitting on shelves too long either.<br /><br />Oh yeah, DON'T EVER BUY COFFEE FROM TJMAXX, MARSHALL'S, ROSS, OR HOME GOODS (I know, they're basically the same store). Every time I've bought a food item from these companies it was horrid!! A batch of coffee I got from TJMaxx turned to dust when I tried to grind it!? They wouldn't take it back either. Even the clothes are irregular, but food items, forgettabboutit.
359	4	I recently ditched sugar and artificial sweeteners and discovered Stevia since it's a healthier alternative and plant-based. However, not all Stevia products are the same and it's a good idea to check out the ingredients since the stevia products you now see on the shelves are not pure stevia. Many contain a corn-based sweetener called erythritol or Stevia in the Raw contains dextrose.<br /><br />I regularly use Sweet Leaf and Kal Stevia as they're both the purest forms of Stevia and would highly recommend those over all others. However, Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Stevia is a great choice over many other brands of Stevia. The ingredients are Organic Agave Inulin, Organic Stevia Extract (Stevia rebaudiana), and Silica and it's certified organic. Agave Inulin is a natural dietary fiber and Silica is a common additive in food products, which is also sold as a mineral supplement. It's something we already have in our bodies and it's essential for increasing bone strength.<br /><br />Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Stevia has no bitter after taste and I find that one packet sweetens my coffee just as well as two teaspoonfuls of sugar. If you're looking to make the switch from sugar and artificial sweeteners, this is definitely a smarter choice.
360	1	I ordered this for gifts around Christmas time. I actually was hoping to use it for our Christmas day meal. Two out of the four jars I ordered were rotten and inedible. I never did get to try it and I was very annoyed and disappointed!
361	5	I've been looking for new and interesting candy to try. The reviewer who said that this tastes like strawberry is right; it's just perhaps a tiny bit more sour. That said, the candies are good. They're individually wrapped in clear plastic with printed white text. You get about 24 of them in a bag.<br /><br />The only reason I'm not giving this five stars is because of how similar it is to strawberry candy. Aside from curiosity and the luxury of imported candies, you may as well just get domestic strawberry candy instead.<br /><br />Update: I've changed this review to five stars, and here's why: I had given out some candies to people to try, but I didn't really stick around while they ate them, OR I was eating the candy myself, and I missed out on the most unusual, unique, and wonderful thing about this candy.<br /><br />This candy makes you smell wonderful. You can't smell it if you eat it, though. The smell is strong but incredibly pleasant. It's also hard for people to pin down-- fruity, sugary perfume, or fruity, sugary food? Now my coworkers have a running joke that whenever someone eats a lychee candy, they're obligated to breathe on everyone else. Not that they need to-- since one or two people eating this candy will fill a whole room with "W, what smells wonderful?! What is that??"<br /><br />So if you want to attract people, literally, eat this candy. It's become my favorite and signature sweet, and everyone wants one as soon as they know I've gotten a package in.
362	5	I happen to love this tea, but it's a very heavy spice flavor and if I drink too much, I do get a lot of heart burn!  If you are one that lives on tums, this might not be for you!  Even the smell of the tea as it's brewing will scent your home, it's that strong!  Yum!
363	5	This coffee is the best tasting and highest-quality you can get for the price.  It's difficult to find in my area's stores and when I can find it, it's very over-priced.  I can't go a morning without my LavAzza!
364	4	I've been using for a few days now and I don't really have any complaints about this product.  I have sensitive skin (have always had it) and so I'm always weary about how different products are going to affect my skin (positively or negatively) but I haven't had the issues that some of the other reviewers have had.  My skin has not broken out after use, and my skin does not feel dry at all, in fact with all this cold weather we've been having, my face especially feels better than it has in a while.  Like others have mentioned (even when complaining about other things), the soap lathers up great, washes off easily, cleanses nicely with the grains and it smells nice (nothing spectacular thought).<br /><br />I do have an issue with the chemical contents, but I have yet to see any adverse reactions to me or my family (and like one reviewer, I have a young daughter, but she hasn't broken out from exposure).  If something like this happens anytime soon, I'll be sure to amend my review with a cautionary blurp.<br /><br />One minor issue with the bottle itself is the cap.  It isn't the easiest to open when you're wet or cramped in the shower.  It doesn't have an easily `poppable' cap.  Like I said, minor issue.<br /><br />Like the other reviewers, I have always been a fan of Dove (sounds weird to say that I am a fan of soap, but they make good products and are really the only supplier of soap to our home).  At this point I'd recommend this, based on my own experience, but I'd also take into consideration the other reviews because every situation is different, and I may be singing a different song in a week or two.<br /><br />For now, I'm happy.
365	5	What can I say about these other than that they are very addicting-or is it addictive? &lt;g><br /><br />If you like cheese puffs, I have no doubt that you'll like these and they're way better for you than regular cheese puffs. Not only do they have an extremely yummy taste and texture, they are also lower in fat than the others.<br /><br />If you have kids, these would be better to give them (shoot, they'd be better to give you, too! &lt;VBG>) than the extremely high-fat cheese puffs you find in every store, and the price from Amazon isn't too bad, especially if you catch them when they're on sale for twelve dollars instead of 18.74. But, even 18.74 is a better price than you find in most grocery stores who carry them, so, go for it! But...don't blame me when you find yourself eating an entire bag in one sitting...
366	5	This fragrant black tea has the subtle flavor of lychee fruit infused into the tea.  Delicious to enjoy either hot or cold.  Two infusions from each measurement of leaves.  This is my favorite go-to black tea.  I have ordered it in the tins (which are nice for the office, travel, etc.), but being able to order it in bulk by the pound on subscription is ideal.  How delightful to be able to have the tea delivered to my door ;-)
367	3	I got this for my 60lb boxer mix as a replacement for smaller one he had managed to break by dropping it. It was great for a couple days, but after that he seemed to get frustrated & in a mere 24 hours, he had chewed through the much thicker rope on the new one, which he had never thought of doing on the old one.  Another new toy, doomed to failure.  &lt;sigh>  oh well, at least I tried.
368	5	WOW!! I was doing just fine until my little one started hitting mini-growth spurts. I had been giving her a bottle of pumped milk twice a day when I had to take medicine that I didn't want in my system when I nursed. So, when I got off the medicine, I noticed that those times of day, I was not producing AT ALL. If you don't use it, you lose it, so they say. I was desperately nursing every hour just for my girl to get SOMETHING and stimulate production, but it didn't work and we were both frustrated and tired.<br /><br />I read about Fenugreek seed and couldn't find it, but stumbled upon this tea. Within 24 hours I was so engorged that I had to pump!! I now still use it just to be able to store up frozen milk for when my husband and I go out or I run an errand and don't want to have to find somewhere to nurse. My milk supply now doesn't even begin to run out when I use the pumped milk and skip nursing.<br /><br />I wish that I could tell every mom about this. I think less women would give up on nursing due to lack of milk, if they knew about this tea! And it's so inexpensive. I drink at least 2 cups a day. I love the taste. It's sweet and minty. I just add a little sugar.
369	5	I sent this to my mom and it was a big hit!  I had to call the order in since it was going to Alaska and their customer service was great.  Very friend, actually left me with a smile on my face when I got off the phone.  The basket arrived sooner then expected! (Which is worth an extra star to me.) It was beautifully done and I totally recommend their service if you are trying to buy for someone who already has everything. Everything came as discribed.  My mother was very pleased with the volume of the contents.  You can't go wrong with this company.  I will use them again for Christmas for those hard to shop for people on my list.
370	4	Busy. Busy. Busy. Tis the season to run around and get run down. The Ambrosoli-Honee Energy Plus Vitamin caramels are a delicious way to boost your immune system and stay healthy on the go.<br /><br />There's no yucky tang or aftertaste, just the flavor of caramel and honey. This supplement is buttery and sweet, and you don't have to feel guilty about indulging. I was pleasantly surprised these.
371	2	Sorry, just don't like these as well as the refried beans that this company makes.  I would buy the refried beans over these.
372	5	The Donut House Decaf has a great coffee flavor and seems to be near acid free. A great alternative to people who do not like the dark robust European flavor. I love them both and alternate between the Green Mountain Robust Magic and Donut House. Having tried most of the brands on the market these 2 stand out to me as having the best coffee flavor.<br />If you don't like to drink "brown water" (stay away from the organic Newman's Own Decaf - horrid!) the Donut House is for you!
373	3	While my pup absolutely loves these they don't last long at all. I have a 6 month old Beagle mix and the normal size Flossie will last about 15 minutes until it's completely gone. I would LOVE to be able to find something that holds his interest like Flossies but lasted longer. He doesnt seem to like rawhide and even turns his nose up to certain biscuits! The only good thing is the local shelter is getting alot of free treats donated from me! :P<br /><br />You can find these cheaper than they are here with free shipping if you search around, but paying over $100 for 50 of these is still quite high for such a short lasting chew.
374	3	These cookies are very similar to garden variety wheat based chocolate chip cookies, they have similar texture and snap, but these are both vegan and gluten free, which matches my requirements.  My celiac disease makes me very sensitive to wheat and these cookies do not trigger any reaction.<br /><br />The cookies are if anything a little more crisp than most, but not at all hard or difficult to chew.  They certainly contain sugar.  I do not eat these everyday because they are so sweet, but I do like them and may very well subscribe to them.<br /><br />If I were rating these only on flavor and texture I'd give them 4 stars, but Lucy annoyed me by creating a bizzarre nutrition panel.  Each package contains 4 cookies.  They state it is 1.3 servings, then go on to say one serving has 130 calories.  So each package seems to contain 169 calories, possibly over some people's limit for a snack.  But let's be honest, these cookies with lots of organic cane sugar have a lot of calories.  Each cookie must weigh in at a bit over 40 calories.<br /><br />For years we have known that 42 is the answer to life, the universe, and everything.  Now we know it is a cookie worth of calories too, tasty calories.  Will buy again.
375	5	I found this brand and the fact that it was dark chocolate made it by far the best I've had for my Keurig.  I will continue to order this particular brand.
376	4	The Melitta coffee has a bright vanilla flavor, not overpowering but well-balanced.  My only reservation is that the underlying coffee itself is not excellent.  Most of us will not notice.
377	5	I purchased these truffles as a birthday gift and I was very pleased with this gift! The truffles arrived with the ice packs to keep them cool while they were being shipped and also in a chest. Because this product us no longer sold in stores in my area this was the best way to go. I'm so glad that I chose this product as a gift it was well worth it.
378	5	Wish it had rollers, but it works fine the way it is. Sits right underneath my Keurig brewer and doesn't take up hardly any countertop.
379	5	I had never heard of this brand of mayo, but from the reviews I thought I would try it.  This is the very best mayo that I have ever eaten and it will be my only mayo from now on.
380	5	I make  iced green tea because I find drinking water bearable rather than enjoyable. And green tea is healthier than other non-water beverages, but I don't love green tea, either. So I've tried various flavored green teas, and the fruit-flavored ones usually result in a sort of sicky-sweet fruitiness mixed with the dirt flavor of green tea. This one, however, is the most tolerably-flavored green tea I've found so far, almost enjoyable, even.
381	5	I have used catnip spray for many years. I generally put it on new scratching posts that I want the cats to use and I renew the spray from time to time just to keep them acclimated to the use of the posts and not the curtains. When toys are no longer interesting, a bit of spray livens them up. If the cats are bored, I spray the toy of the moment and that  gets kitty minds off the mischievious and back onto the game at hand.<br />I noticed that the bottle of spray that I had been using had lost its ability to interest, and it IS about 5 years old, so I decided to get a new bottle and naturally turned to Amazon as the easiest source for my need. I was dismayed to note that many of the sprays for sale had gotten bad reviews. Writers had stated that this or that spray smelled bad, or did not work, OR Smelled bad and sent the cat away instead of providing entertainment. So I carefully looked through the availability of various sprays and settled on this one.<br />It is made by a reputable company that specializes in products made from naturally grown herbs.<br />When the spray arrived, I first used it on a cat scratching product that had been a favorite, but had lapsed into disuse. After carefully spraying it, I waited a few seconds (literally) and here came my grey kitty with huge dilated pupils. He looked at me briefly and plunged right in and began rolling, playing and scratching. Then the shyer girl tiptoed over to see what the fun was and joined in.<br />So that I could get into the fun fest, I sprayed "Da Birds" (one for each cat) and hung the birds just out of reach of the kitties. Here they came and the games began. We played for about 15 minutes.<br />So I am well pleased with this products and so are my kitters.It was just what I had in mind. As usual with catnip spray, I can detect no odor, though I believe some people can smell a bit a a minty fragrance.<br />I certainly recommend this product as "The catnip spray to use!"
382	5	What's to say about this? It is great tasting cereal. This is probably the best tasting and healthist "sugary" Cheerios variety. Most of the other sugary Cheerios are not very healthy compared to regular Cheerios and the Honey Nut Cheerios. At the time I purchased from amazon, amazon had a better price than Sam's Club so I bought several boxes.
383	3	I sent this to someone as a gift and the contents were melted and clumped together. The package was not sitting outside. Please improve your packaging.
384	4	I saw the one negative review here and because the price I was about to pay was exceptionally cheap(it was on some sort of special at the time), I decided to take a chance. I have to report that my experience was quite the opposite of the negative review I read. The order I recieved was fresh and the product is excellent. I love torrone and this is very good. My only criticism is simply that torrone itself is so good, coating it in chocolate, beleive it or not, only detracts from the enjoyment IMHO. If other varieties had been available at the sale price I paid, I'd likely have chosen the plainer or simpler variety over this one.<br /><br />The only other point I'd like to make is that it is true that Amazon is notorious for sending out stale and near out of date grocery items. Old stuff seems to be especially true when it's on one of their specials. The previous reviewer may well have recieved a bad shipment as they described. Whether it was luck or timing, the order I got was very good and it was exceptionally cheap.
385	5	I bought this to make some chocolate covered Strawberries for a friend and they were awesome, tasted awesome and you couldn't even tell it didn't have any sugar added, he loved them.
386	4	The eternal dieter's quest: A replacement for oily, fatty, and oh-so-addictive real potato chips. Sure, you can get the baked versions, but they lack a bit in both the crunch and flavor categories. And they cost a lot.<br /><br />So the quest continues. I got a case of these PopChips, cheddar flavor, through Amazon, inspired by a good sale and thoughts of "there must be something better".<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the calorie count: A substantial 3oz bag of these chips (a lunch bag is 1oz) has only 360 calories (120 calories per "serving"), of which 35 are fat calories. Those are better numbers than tradition potato chips, which run around 160 calories for a 1oz serving, and which get 80-90 of those calories from fat. (Calorie counts can vary dramatically upward depending on the chips, but these numbers are typical). Better--and this is where the calories don't tell the whole story--a 1 oz serving feels larger, because these PopChips are puffed larger.<br /><br />But don't let that word "puff" scare you. They DO have a major non puffy tasting solid crunch to them. The flavor is also pretty good and the best part: Look Ma, no orange crap on my hands! That's a big plus for a cheddar flavored chip...Take that Cheetos!<br /><br />I liked the cheddar ones so much, I ordered the BBQ ones as well, and they're even better tasting (IMHO).<br /><br />One thing to note: These are low(er) fat, low(er) calories, but not low sodium. A 1oz portion has 290mg of sodium (12% of the recommended daily intake for a normal person). If you are on a salt restricted diet, or if you don't like salt, think twice...<br /><br />On the whole, these are good, tasty, and most importantly, satisfying, while at the same time less caloric (and much less fatty) than standard potato chips. They are saltier than many would prefer, but presuming you are not on a salt restricted diet, they'll be OK. As a bonus, they are supposed "all natural". Personally, I don't care about that last point, but it's certainly not a bad thing!<br /><br />One last thing: You will find some diets that claim it's not the calories, it's the source of the calories. Hogwash. It IS the calories. No chip is diet worthy in big quantities. Consider the calories and  your total caloric intake, and make the personal decision whether these make sense.<br /><br />Try them yourself...Amazon offers a sampler package with multiple varieties, and that might be the best way to sample them.
387	3	This appears to be the last place to sell canned figs.  The Oregon brand used to market them through super markets but quit, probably because of low demand.  However, the Roland figs are "tougher" then Oregon.  The only guess I have is that Oregon picked their figs later or processed them in a way to make them more tender.  However, if you are fan of canned figs you should buy them.  The taste is nearly the same as Oregon but the texture is more firm which may not bother other buyers.
388	5	You know I would have given this item 5 stars except for the fact that when my package arrived, one of the bottles was opened. The coconut oil is very easily turned into a liquid, and because of this, my package was all slippery and slimy. Now I should have returned it but I was too lazy to return so I kept it. The bottle that was not opened was fine and was exactly what I wanted. So besides one of my coconut oil bottles being opened and leaking a little which lead to me throwing it away, all else was fine.
389	5	My dog would be happy with just this food, he eats it up quick and never hesitates to eat it.
390	5	I received a few of Primal Foods products at Christmas, and I couldn't believe how good these are. I've had meat eaters try them and got rave reviews. They're actually better than the real meat sticks, these aren't greasy. I bought 1 box of 24 already, back to buy more!
391	5	my son loves them<br /><br />yummy<br /><br />they are pricey but again when you are gluten free it is almost to be expected.<br /><br />they are so convenient to pack away and take with you on trips.<br /><br />they are not as sweet as nutrigrain bars but still very good quality
392	5	We've been trying various rices including Aquarello Carnaroli and this Vialone Nano is by far the best. It's very forgiving of lapses in technique and produced the creamiest risotto of the five brands of rice we've tried.<br /><br />Be sure to have an airtight container to store the unused rice from each package - the vacuum pack plastic is too stiff to close well.
393	1	When I started drinking Sparkling Ice, I was really excited, I told all my friends about this new found jewel. Well my excitement was short lived. This drink, sparkles all over the place...uhhh. What i'm saying is that it is so carbonated that you have to make sure you open the same bottle with caution everytime you want to drink it, otherwise it will explode all over your clothes, books etc, which I experienced. I was so mad I thought I may like the taste but lm not going to be on the edge each time I want to open a bottle I have already been drinking from. Its like you cannot afford to be distracted if you want to drink Sparkling Ice that's for sure....
394	5	This is the best flavor of gum I have ever tried.  I wasn't even in the habit of chewing gum often, but this gum is making me into a habitual gum chewer.  I like it so much!  One thing that you should know about this flavor is that not everyone likes it.  Several of my family members don't like it much at all.  However, I think the flavor is amazing, and quake at the thought that they might discontinue it some day.  What would I do?  There's nothing even similar.  This gum freshens your breath, but it isn't as harsh as some of the other Eclipse minty flavors.  It's mildly spicy, but not quite as strong as most cinnamon gums, I would say.  It does have a pleasant sweet spicy flavor that lasts and lasts.  In fact, one odd (but in my mind, wonderful) thing about this flavor is that it actually gets stronger as you chew it longer!  I don't know how they did that.  It contains cardamom (a spice used in gingerbread and also in Indian curries).<br /><br />Please try it!  I'm desperate for you to try it and like it.  We've got to get more people buying this gum so that the flavor is never discontinued.
395	5	I love green teas and have tried many different kinds. Sometimes it's a hassle to make tea at work or on the go, which is why I gave Ito En Sencha Shot a try. I was very happy with it. You can drink it hot or cold. When it is hot it is a smooth, earthy and strong tea. Perfect for mornings. When cold it is about twice as strong and almost tastes like grass. Which I think is good in the afternoon. You will get a boost of energy and get a full feeling after drinking this. It is a wonderful drink and it is really good for you!
396	5	Zoe is made from big fat olives that are meaty and buttery tasting. When my husband and I went to the Pennsylvania Macaroni Company in Pittsburgh, PA, the olive oil buyer guided us through our first olive oil purchase. She had us eat the olives that went into different kinds of olive oil and then pick the olives we liked best. Our first purchase of Zoe was the result. It is an olive oil with a distinctly buttery taste. I use it in baking cakes whenever oil or melted butter is called for. It tastes great! Absolutely great! Plus, it's heart healthy, which butter is not. Sigh. Other olives, particularly Italian olives that are made into olive oil are very peppery. Hence, their oil is peppery. This might be what other people are talking about when they say they don't like Zoe. Zoe is not a bit peppery. So please, you must try for yourself in this case. It is not a good idea to take anyone else's product review for olive oil to heart. (a pun!) You must decide what you like in an olive oil and buy according. Also, I want to mention that the buttery taste stays there even through a saute. We bought different types of Italian olive oil in smaller bottles that same first time at the Pennsylvania Macaroni Company, and then we came home and made fried eggs with all of them. In that venue the taste of the olive oils really came through and Zoe kept that buttery taste. Good eating!
397	5	Purchased these by the case since they are so hard to find in my local store.  Also enlisted in the auto delivery program.  The only problem is by purchasing them 12 at a time - they are always in the house and tempting me.  Will never go back to regular chips again.
398	5	My grandson loves this mac and cheese and I figure if he's going to eat alot of something it might as well be something healthy. It's much more reasonably priced thru Amazon..especially with the subscribe and save.
399	5	I don't like the fact that if you tilt this forward that the drawers slide out pretty easily.<br /><br />Otherwise I like this organizer. it was the biggest one I could find in the style I wanted.
400	5	I love the taste of the Breakfast Blend K-Cup coffee. You can't find a better deal<br />anywhere else. keep up the great work
401	3	If you microwave it for 10-15 seconds (after you take it out of the package) it's much improved, like it just came out of the oven. I don't care for it at room temp. And there's lots of good fiber and nutrition, and the plant sterols that lower cholesterol.
402	1	The Pour Over cheese popcorn was FANTASTIC. This stuff is awful. They need to take this crud off the market and put back the Pour over Cheddar popcorn back. Come on Orville give your customer what they want.
403	2	I find it curious that you can not find this k-cup on Van Houtte's website.  You can find the Raspberry Chocolate Truffle light but not this specific k-cup. Given some of the very negative reviews of this product,  perhaps it is a discontinued item or maybe it is not a Van Houtte product.
404	5	Crown Prince Natural Skinless & Boneless Sardines are the best sardines I have EVER eaten!  I'm trying to lose weight and eat healthier, and when one of the attorneys in our office prepared a plate of sardines, sliced tomatoes and cottage cheese for lunch, I was intrigued.  He let me try the sardines and I was hooked!  They are absolutely delicious!  And they don't have that strong "fishy" smell most sardines have.  Unfortunately, my local grocery store doesn't carry them so I was extremely pleased to be able to order a case from Amazon, and I'll keep on ordering them until I can get them locally.
405	5	My wife is a tea lover.  She finds Stash Premium White Christmas Tea soothing & delightful.  I thought the price was great, too.
406	5	I love Kinder Surprise eggs and am bummed that we don't have them here in the states.  These chocolates were delicious!  Very creamy.  I was going to buy them to put in stockings but they just sat in my cupboard staring at me so I had to try "just one".  Yeah... that didn't happen.  I ended up calling my daughters into the room and we sat and enjoyed the candy together.  I guess I'll have to buy these again to put in stockings for Christmas. Oh darn! :)
407	1	Too bad I couldn't have ordered just one can. It tastes horrible. Hopefully someone at the food pantry will like to have the rest of the case.
408	1	I wanted the Chicken Noodle Bowl, but not the Spicy Chicken, which is what I received. Nowhere in the description of this product does it say "Spicy". It is too spicy for my taste.
409	5	I can't buy locally so amazon is my go to place.<br />This is my favorite tea ever, if you like licorice<br />flavored anything, you will really enjoy this tea.<br />No sweetener needed!
410	4	There are other miso soups I like more, but what I love about this one is that there is tofu and spinach, so I really feel like I'm getting a boost of nutrition. I can have it any time of day, too, and find myself having this while others drink coffee (and feeling pretty good about that).
411	2	The cookies were out of date they only had a couple of days left before they expired when I recieved them.
412	1	Very unhappy because I had ordered these Elmo pops for my twin grandchildren's 2nd birthday. They were suppose to arrive between Sept. 17-20. Their birthday party was Sept. 22 and the 2 packages of Elmo pops arrived the following Wednesday AFTER the party, on Sept. 26. I have expressed my unhappiness with the company I received these from - SavingsforLittleBlessings and returned the 2 packages unopened. They were supposed to be for the children's party bags as they left the birthday party.<br />I will not be buying anything from SavingsforLittleBlessings again.
413	5	I have tried several different brands and up to this point, NUTIVA is my favorite.  I have been using this for several years.  Great for cooking and for health purposes just eating off the spoon is not bad.
414	5	The review by Michigan Money  is not related to the product and really has no bearing on this product. I have used blue buffalo for years and found it to be one of the best products in terms of content and health for my dogs. I have a dog with an extremely sensitive stomach. It turns out there is a common sensitivity to gluten and certain grains. Using Blue solved this problem.
415	3	So when I sent in a complaint to Amazon I realized that I indeed ordered this medium roast box, but my surprise was finding "Bold, Decaffinated" etc, well I own that one for not reading about what came with this box exactly, but what I don't own, is the myriad of Expired k cups, like Jan, Feb and May 2011. Anytime something says expired and you just bought it, well, that doesn't instill a lot of confidence in how the company inventories their products.
416	5	The dried fruit and pistachios were really good.  Would purchase again from this company.
417	5	We first had this from our neighbourhood specialty grocery. My wife mocks me but even with shipping the five pound package via Amazon is cheaper. And the bacon is some of the best you will ever have. Well worth it, in our opinion.
418	5	While I am no fan of coffee, other members in my household love it.  This got rave reviews.<br /><br />This looks like it comes in a tea bag.  It's easy to make; you just brew it for a few minutes and wring it out.  You can make it the way you make tea by applying the bag concept.  This was a big hit with the coffee hounds.<br /><br />.
419	1	It's all cayenne and not authentic bebere. way too spicy, threw it out and made my own.
420	5	My kids seriously think this is chocolate milk.  I can smell the difference but they love it.  My almost 2 year old got the cup from her brother and got in MAYBE 2 sips and the whole day her tummy was messed up after that.  So I wouldnt give it to the little ones.  But my older 2 love it.
421	5	I had heard about this new drink, but a Whole Foods is not near me. when I found it on Amazon I had to try it. Congrats to the developers on making a drink that tastes great, but without all of the sugar and other ingredients.
422	1	POULTRY MEAL!!!!!<br />SOYBEAN MEAL!!!<br /><br />WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS COMPANY?? NOW BECAUSE WE WANT GRAIN FREE...THEY STICK THOSE TERRIBLE INGREDIENTS!<br />GOOGLE THOSE INGREDIENTS FOR DOGS...HAVE A BARF BAG NEAR BY!
423	5	good strong coffee. you don't have to use as much as other same coffees to get a great tasting cup of coffee. Receipt of the product was fast and though I had a problem, it was quickly resolved to my satisfaction.
424	3	Every so often, I like to make a batch of pasta fagioli. It is a nice healthy dish, and tastes good! My recipe calls for carrots, celery, onion, cannellini beans, and so on. I have used San Giogio brand ditalini to provide the pasta base for this dish. And this ditalini does its job well. It is not the best pasta I have tasted in this dish, but it is readily available and comes at a good price.<br /><br />All in all, this meets my needs for this dish nicely.
425	2	There are six different types.  Some are terrible such as the vanilla honey (those two flavors don't belong together).  What I use as a standar for good chocolate is the Ferrero Rocher and Lindor truffles that are found for $3 at walmart.  Of the six types from the package only 2 were better than those chocolates, the rest didn't even come close to $3 dollar chocolate brands.  That's why I give them 2 stars out of 5!
426	1	I ordered this for my son and his friend as a gag gift for Christmas. I got two of them and one worked and the other was broken. The spring was cracked. Must have been damaged through the mail not sure.. The one gun that did work was ok but lost interest in it after 30 minutes. I also ordered them the Marshmellow shooter and they both worked and LOVED THEM!!
427	5	These little treats pack a powerful punch.  The "peppery" taste is just the beginning.  They're not too sweet and don't leave you thirsty.  I keep them in my purse for a quick pick me up.  Besides the taste and convenience they make me feel better! Ginger is known for it's effect on ones' immune system.
428	4	My female bulldog has skin allergies and this product really helps her condition.  This is a good price for it with free shipping.
429	1	I bought this coffee after reading the reviews. I have been a black coffee drinker my whole life, but did not like this coffee. I did not have a problem with the pod.  I thought the coffee was terrible and will probably try to give it away.
430	5	I couldn't believe it when I saw these on Amazon. I hadn't seen them in 25 years, since my teens. They've got a great, creamy-honey filling and are still as good as I remembered them.
431	3	The SWITCH ORANGE TANGERINE SODA doesn't taste too bad and it is carbonated, but the taste reminded me of orange juice that went sour. You know, when the O.J. has gone way past the expiration date and you gulp some and it has that bitter acidic taste.<br /><br />Anyway, the soda is made from a combination of apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola juice, and doesn't add sugar, corn syrup, preservatives or artificial colors. It's also gluten free so that's good news for those who are trying to watch what they eat and drink.<br /><br />The 8.3-ounce can is smaller than the standard 12-ounce can of soda and maybe it just takes a couple of tries to get used to the flavor.<br /><br />Like I said, not bad but I'll stick with regular/diet soda. But for a healthier alternative for soda lovers, I suggest trying one of the "SWITCH SODAS" OR any naturally flavored sparkling water.
432	5	I bought this for treating symptoms of menopause.  It has been a life saver.  thank you
433	3	I did not want an extra bold coffee. This is not listed as extra bold, but that is what arrived at my door. Stuck with it, I've been drinking it, but not at all enjoying it. If you like extra bold, maybe you'll like this. Not me. Tastes like old coffee grinds to me.
434	5	not only are these sandals supportive and comfortable(to be expected with an orthotic shoe) they are stylish and available in fun colors. I purchased them in lime green and just love em
435	5	These bags are exactly what I wanted for cat litter. They are a little small but manageable. However, I purchased them because they have a minimal effect on the environment, but they came in a huge box filled with plastic inflatable filling. The box could have fit 40x the product. Do you really need to protect a cardboard box with trash bags in it to that extent? I would have been really happy with an envelope to hold them. Amazon needs to take note. If someone buys an environmentally friendly product, they will look at the entire experience. Shame on Amason!
436	5	The Vigo Mexican Rice is a great accompaniment for a Mexican dinner.  We tried it and we loved it.
437	5	I just switched my 11 and a half year old Boxer to this food and it is awesome! She switched over no problems with no weaning off her old food. It has cut her gas down and has been so easy on her stomach. It also tastes so good to her that she will eat it without wet food mixed in. I wish I had found this food 11 years ago. It is great and we will switch our Boxer puppy to it when it is time. Also...very affordable:)
438	5	I've always been a fan of Numi Tea after a cousin of mine introduced me to it. Although I like all the flavors, my favorite is still Earl Gray Tea. Just love it with creamer and sugar. Whenever I try other teas, I just gotta compare them with numi tea, and the non-numi-tea falls flat and not up to par. Their teas smells so great that as soon as the tea bag dips into hot water, it's an experience by itself already.<br /><br />About the Numi Tea Portfolio - I thought it to be a good Christmas present when I saw it online, but I wanted to get a sample first before giving it as gift. Love the box that came with it. I took out the teas, put it in another container, and used the box as a jewelry box. Voila - instant organized jewelries and watches. It's really great. Whoever will get this for Christmas will surely not be disappointed.
439	5	I tried this tea loved it recomended it and now most of my family uses it flavor is great.
440	5	Rocky loves all types of squeaky toys but this one is the best, he has hours of fun trying to get the rover out of the moon ball. Whenever i have guests i let rocky play with the moon ball and the rover. It keeps him occupied for hours. Its perfect for little dogs with lots of energy. Rocky has little paws that way he can stick his paws in the moon ball and retrieve the rover. Its easy to clean unlike other squeaky toys just wash with water and let dry and its ready to keep him occupied and lets me entertain my guests.
441	5	We have always bought the Gerber Yogurt Melts and my kids were not too much into them. A friend gave me a bag of the Happy Baby Banana Mango yogurt melts.... WOW! The kids (2&4) ate the whole bag- they practically fought over the bag. I thought they had so much more flavor than the Gerber brand. Very happy with the Happy Baby products. Looking forward to trying the other flavors too!
442	5	Marley Coffee's Exotic Floral and Berry "One Love" organic medium Ethiopia Yirgacheffe is a great organic coffee with a rich, bold taste. I haven't tried anything remotely like it; it is definitely addictive. I tend to drink coffee that's heavily diluted with water and have found that the one serving coffee brewing bag can yield two full cups of coffee. However, please note that this is my particular take on drinking it; others may wish instead, a much stronger brew.
443	4	great food choice for those that are looking for alternate protein source. Our dog is allergic to chicken and beef. This is the first food that didn't smell intolerably fishy (even the lesser quality wellness ocean smelled nasty). Believe me, it's still fishy, but tolerable.  After a few weeks on Wellness Core Ocean, her coat is super shiny and soft.  Would purchase again!
444	5	We have been eating Kashi for years and really like it.  The coolest thing about buying it through Amazon is that I can have a subscription!  Imagine, every month (or more depending on your requested interval) you get a note from Amazon asking if it is ok to send this months installment, and for a lower price that I can generally find it in the stores.  At the rate we eat cereal this is a most amazing thing. Thanks Amazon.
445	1	THese bars were horrible. The worst tasting and looking bar that Kashi makes. I would suggest buying any of the other bars but not these.
446	3	This drink doesn't taste bad, and while you are drinking it the taste is rather enjoyable.  But the cans are too small to quench your thirst, and the taste is so light that it is forgotten moments after drinking.  I would compare this to drinking water, but it is not as good.
447	4	Coffe is bold and smooth. Not the strongest but enough for me. If you like smooth coffee without the bitterness try this
448	3	I'm counting carbs, and I ordered these hoping they would provide an alternative for me to high-carbohydrate snacks. The similar veggie chips I have bought in the grocery store list 2 grams of carbs; this product lists 18g; fiber - only 2g -- that's 16 net carbs, way too many allowed on my diet. It would be helpful to have the nutrition facts presented on the product page before purchase (or if it is there - I missed it). Sugar is not listed as an ingredient so I am not sure why these are so high in carbs as the similar product with 2grams lists the same ingredients: sweet potato, squash, carrot, green bean, and taro. The other figures are not bad: calories: 130, fat calories, 50, total fat: 6g; saturated fat: 0g; trans fat: 0g. Although on my low carb diet, I don't have to worry so much about calories and fat. Hope this review is helpful to you.
449	5	I have really sensitive skin; it reacts poorly to almost everything (including hard water), it is dry in spots and oily in others, and it definitely sees a blemish from time to time. I've tried just about every product out there because I am easily swayed by advertisements for new organic facial products, but I always come back to this line. Unlike most products for 'troubled' skin, which contain harsh salicycle acid, this product doesn't make my break-outs worse at all. It's oil free, so even after a long day my nose doesn't feel slick, and it's nice and light so it goes great under make-up. The scent is fantastic and a little jar goes a long way because you need so little of it. If your skin is like mine, I recommend the pineapple enzyme cleanser, the habiscus toner, the papaya mask, and this moisturizer. That regiment keeps me clear, soft, and smelling like the tropics. The only thing I don't use is the eye gel, which is a bit too light for the eye area.
450	5	My son loves these.  He loves the taste and that he can even share these snacks with friends and no one knows they are gluten free.
451	3	when I bought the product in almost mid-July.  I got it quickly enough but was not happy that I had less than a month to use a case!  There was no indication of sell date infomation in the procuct description.
452	4	When my kids found the box of these Annie's snacks, my 10 year old jumped up and down like a bunny and screamed out loud with such a joy.  I'm like.. what the heck.<br /><br />Inside the box were these tiny 0.8oz pouches containing about a dozen "gummy bunnies"  Their texture is like gummy bears, except much softer. The sweetness is just right with a little tang and sourness.<br /><br />Per pouch - 1 serving:  70 calories, 45mg sodium (2%), 18g carbs/10g sugars (6%), and 100% vitamin C. The only unnatural ingredient is the "Natural Flavors", which is will cost a star.<br /><br />Fun snack and recommended.
453	5	I don't know about the energy burst that it is supposed to give you, but it was arguably some of the best jerky that I have ever had. It is moist and very flavorful, well worth the price.
454	5	i love this brand, it smells and taste so good, well worth it. i put it in my toddler son's milk as an extra booste to his nutrition and he loves it. Good for hair and skin too; great all around for health.
455	4	I'll give these 4* for now, because I love everything except the flavor.  The protein in these shakes is very high quality.  It's a mix of 7 different components and the predominant one is whey.  Perfect for drinking after a workout.  Amazingly, they have no sugar and are pretty low in fat.<br /><br />For the Cookies & Cream, I'm still on the fence about the flavor.  I love the Vanilla and I've been drinking 4-5 of them per week for years.  The Cookies & Cream tastes as advertised when it goes down.  But the aftertaste has a kind of bite to it that's hard to describe.  I suspect I'll get used to it and keep ordering this flavor for variety.  But it won't replace my staple Vanilla.
456	5	Really good! These are more expensive than other brands, $4 per can at Safeway, but the difference is obvious once you open and taste the fish.
457	5	I've been using the Nutiva brand for 2 years now.  It has the best flavor of any of the brands in the nutrition and grocery stores.  When I used the other brands I rarely used the coconut oil.  They smelled and tasted yucky.  Plus I found out they were processed.  Nutiva is raw.  I have completely thrown out shortening; butter; and probably cut back at least half on the olive oil I used.<br />My chronically dry skin is gone without lotions.  I use it on toast or bread as a snack and I feel full and satisfied for hours. And I have seen a lot less water retention all over....not so puffy.  Wish I could say I lost weight or inches, but no, I didn't.  I have heard of others losing as soon as they start switching to coconut oil.  When I bake with it instead of shortening or butter...everything is so moist...no coconut flavor added to anything either.
458	1	I just purchased two boxes from a Chinese store in Plano Texas. I could not find a " Do not sell date " unless it is the date on the inside cover of the lid. The date is 7/2010. The chocolate has a white coating and has a old tasting Flavor. I will not purchase this product again. I called the company and the voice said I was next in line, However,five minutes went by and no one activated the line, I hung up and give this a 1.
459	5	I remember these from when I was a kid...they haven't changed a bit.  Yummy drink inside the wax bottle.  My 8 year old son and his friends love them
460	5	If crack came in food form this would be it. Adults and children have yet to grow tired of this snack. Great alternative to much more fattening snack foods. 1/2 the calories of a candy bar, more filling and better tasting.<br />I buy two boxes at a time to save on shipping. Amazon once processed my order twice and the vendor called me to make sure it wasn't a mistake. I appreciate great service like that.
461	5	This almond paste is a great product, it just that there is a lot of it.  I wish they would produce a 1 or 2 pound can.  One good thing is we can make a lot of almond cookies with it.<br /><br />The paste works well in recipes and turns out without being gritty which was a problem trying to make our own past.  Good flavor and no noticeable difference in finished product from home made.  this will work with just about any recipe that calls for almonds in a paste or even in some cases a powder form.
462	5	This water was bottled at 9.5 and although by the time it reaches us its probably closer to 8.5, that is still excellent. My body absorbs this water much better than any other, I drink just as much but urinate half as much as before. I use it in my soups, coffee, etc. This water and replacing standard refined table salt with pink himalayan salt in my diet has increased my energy 10-fold. This may not be the magic bean for everyone's body, but I love it. Tastes silky smooth too.<br /><br />**UPDATE Sept 2012** - I ordered 3 types of bottled high-ph water: NeoWater, AlkaPure, and Essentia, then tested them with PH testing strips. The Essentia water tested at 9.0, the AlkaPure at 9.3, and the NeoWater at 7.1! Thanks, Essentia, for ensuring the quality of your water. I remain a happy customer :) I'll try to post the picture of the tests to the product page.
463	4	People whose dogs have corn allergies should limit their purchases to the Vanilla Mint and the Wheatfree Veggie-Chicken flavors, which don't contain corn gluten.  Without the corn gluten, I'd have given the Everlasting Treat 5 stars.
464	5	Starbucks Breakfast Blend is a mild roast with none of the bitter aftertaste seen with Pike Place Roast. Since Pike has become the "default" blend at Starbucks locations including airport locations like ORD and IAD I've learned to search for alternatives including MacD and BK.
465	5	These bars taste great. The ingredient list is nice and short. They're a little brittle and can break easily. That's not a problem for me so I give these tasty treats 5 stars.
466	2	I used to travel in Canada mostly Quebec City, Quebec. There I discovered Leclerc Maple Creme Cookies they were absolutly the best I have ever ate.I recently ordered 3 boxes of them from Amazon grocery.They arrived stale and broken I will not order any more unless they come from Quebec City.The cookies that I received came from and were made in Tennesee.<br />They were smaller than the ones I had in Quebec City and did not taste half as good. I will not buy anymore that are made in the states unless they are certified by Leclerc. Leclerc Canada makes excellent cookies their USA counterpart<br />does not.
467	5	These noodles are a bit pricier than the cheap-o brands but they are much more delicious. Totally recommended if you need instant soup for long work nights like me!
468	5	We received the package fine. I give some of these to others who also love this candy.  BIG BAG, good candy.
469	4	One of my favorite flavored coffees available in K-cups.  Good for a Sunday morning cup of joe and a good read!
470	3	I agree that the shipping is too high.  A little too fishy for my taste and I prefer larger eggs. Also, a previous reviewer is right about the green stool factor. Probably too much added color. It is what it is.
471	5	There is nothing really special about these t-discs coffee. It's not very strong, but it does radiate a fresh roasty flavor when brewed. This is definitely the most convenient way for me to brew coffee while in the office where I don't want to deal with the mess of coffee beans.
472	5	This is a great snack.  I first bought them for my 17 month old grandson, who has celiac disease.  He loves them; so do I.  One ounce of these chips is equivalent to one and one half servings of vegetables!  They are very lightly salted, and have 80% less fat than potato chips.  The chips are kind of cute - much smaller than potato chips and shaped like a tiny bowl.  My grandson will put one on the end of his tongue and wait for me to laugh - he's such a clown!
473	5	As another reviewer has mentioned you can make this calorie free by using Splenda instead of sugar which is exactly what we do.  We always keep a pitcher of Kool Aid with Splenda in the fridge when you want something "sweet" but don't want to drink down a couple hundred calories.  It's a great guilt free way to satisfy that craving.<br /><br />For those reviewers saying the cost is too high:  Each packet makes about 64 oz.  64oz x 48 packets = 3072 oz.  By my math thats the equivalent of 153 20oz bottles of Diet Coke which would cost you over a hundred dollars.  Don't look it as 50 cents a pack but less then a penny a ounce and you'll realize its not a bad price at all.
474	5	I bought the peanut butter flavored treats for my 9 week old Lab puppy and she LOVES them. They are perfect for training. She has learned 3 commands in one day with these treats. I was also very pleased to see that the first ingredient is peanut butter, not enriched flour.
475	2	As others have said, this is REALLY MILD in flavor!  The instructions call for 1 packet per 16 oz. of water.  There are 6 packets per box.<br /><br />I decided to give it a try as I am basically lazy and wanted some (unsweetened; unlemoned) iced tea that I could make on a moment's whim.<br /><br />I started with 1 packet per 16 oz of water; then 2 packets per 16 oz of water and got SOME flavor.  Now I'm using 3 packets per 16 oz. of water.  (I placed a fairly large order so I could experiment with it AND have it throughout the fall and winter.)<br /><br />Since I'm using triple the amount of product in order to get some flavor, I will probably not order this item again.
476	5	great old brew from home. dont know why americans suck so bad at making tea...its not hard to figure out how to boil water...not hot water but boiling water...
477	2	This is a decent green tea, but there is no distinguishing chai flavor at all. All this tea tastes like is an average cup of green tea.
478	5	Counting rescue kitties I have 13 cats that I "treat" on a daily basis and not a one turns their nose up on this particular flavor. The fact that they help with tartar control is an added bonus.
479	3	I ordered this thinking it was just coconut milk, but there are a few other ingredients in there as well. Next time I will pay more for the organic version, which reviewers have said has less added "stuff." But for the price you get a great tasting coconut milk that makes delicious ice cream. If you don't mind the extra "stuff" this is 5 stars.
480	5	I had my doubts when I first ordered canned sockeye salmon but after mixing it into a rice dish I was very impressed with the flavor.  Good flavor and a health food to boot.
481	2	This flavor has an overwhelming peanut, i.e. peanut butter flavor with a tart, fruity flavor reminding me of a PB&J sandwich.  I didn't enjoy it but that may be because I don't like peanut butter.  Too many peanuts ("nuts" to me doesn't mean a majority of peanuts) and too tart of fruit, too pasty texture of fruit as well as too much of it.  I prefer nutty with no peanuts and chewy, sweeter fruit pieces.  My bars were fresh and chewy (a tad on the soft side).  I'd picked up various flavors at small local stores and enjoyed them so grabbed this when it went on sale to try.  I'll not buy this flavor again but do recommend the brand.
482	4	I bought this as a gift for Mother's day.  My mom's really into boxes and loved the boxes it came in.  She also enjoyed the tea, though a couple were too exotic for her.  The main problem is that the pot is very fragile.  My mom is always extremely careful with things, so the fact that she managed to break the lid when cleaning it means something.  Overall it was still a successful gift though.
483	5	coarse salt from an old supplier in Trapani, Sicily. This is 12 kilos of salt--yes 2.2 pound boxes, or more than 26 pounds. Works well in a grinder
484	1	ABSOLUTELY  the worst peanutbutter i've ever tasted! Dont waist your money!this product is worse than dog food! and the smell is even worse!
485	1	very over powering taste and smell, didn't like and gets stuck in your teeth, prefer just powder or liquid form
486	5	Due to an allergy in the family, we use soynut butter instead of peanut butter.  The I.M. Healthy brand is indeed peanut free (you'd be surprised at how many soy nut butters actually include peanuts, are processed in the same facility as peanuts, etc).  The prices the local grocery stores charge for this product individually are outrageous.  The six-pack product on Amazon is a great deal - we go through it quickly enough that we don't have to worry about it going bad, etc, when we buy in quantity.
487	4	We bought a large popcorn machine for our children and our guests and it's a hit!!  Everyone loves it.  It's just like being at a movie and it's super easy to use.
488	2	I had ordered the salted soy nuts but the non-salted soy nuts were shipped instead. I certainly would have prefered the salted soy nuts that I had ordered.
489	5	These are tasty hard candies. We love to take them to the theatre to suck on during performances. Only problem is in the metal container they can make a lot of noise unless you're careful.
490	5	Just adding this to my normal diet routine has caused a big difference in my weight loss.  I'm not hungry and have plenty of energy - a huge change from before I started drinking it.  I was actually a little concerned at first due to the sudden drop in weight.  I thought I was losing water weight but I was wrong.  I use about a teaspoon/teaspoon and a half per day and brew it 4 times - about 8 cups - per day.  As a bonus, it tastes pretty good too.
491	5	I love this cracker. It is light, crisp and doesn't have a lot of calories. What I don't understand is why amazon has increased the price so much. If I am going to pay for 12 boxes I ought to get a bit of a discount. I can get it at my local grocer for less cost and I only have to buy one box at a time.
492	3	These are okay. Not something I'd want to drink every day.  A bit of an artificial taste.  Nothing great, but they're drinkable.
493	5	All I can say is wow, this flavor is wonderful. When its brewing, the smell is outstanding and you can actually taste the chocolate. Very satisfied, not watery. Aroma is pleasing, not bitter and no after taste. I am ordering more. Yum!!!
494	5	I was used to pick Chamomile flowers for tea myself years ago.This tea reminds me of the quality of home made chimmile tea.You cant go wrong with it
495	1	I think the ingredients in this food speak for themselves - cheap filler & byproducts supplemented with vitamins.  After doing a tiny amount of research on cat nutrition I was absolutely disgusted with myself for feeding this food to my cat for over 3 years.  I am also disgusted that so many veterinarians have apparently been bought off by the Hill's company.<br /><br />This Science Diet formula's first 8 ingredients:<br />1 - Brewers rice: Filler. Processed rice product that is missing many of the nutrients contained in whole ground rice. (Cat's don't need grain, and this is the first ingredient!)<br />2 - Chicken By Product Meal: Parts of chicken not fit for human consumption, i.e. head, feet, bones, entrails, blood, intestines, etc.<br />3 - Corn Gluten Meal: Corn byproduct used as an inexpensive protein source.  Many cats and dogs are allergic to corn and, again, cats are carnivores and do not need grain.<br />4 - Powdered Cellulose:  Sawdust!<br />5 - Ground Whole Grain Corn:  More cheap, HYPER allergenic grain that cats don't need.<br />6 - Chicken Liver Flavor:  Self explanatory, but why not just use real chicken liver?<br />7 - Animal Fat: Fat from an unnamed animal source, most likely fat from many types of animals that the Hills company would rather not name.<br />8 - Soybean Mill Run: Soybean hulls - a cheap, byproduct filler.  Soy is also highly allergenic.<br /><br />The funny thing - anyone who buys Science Diet knows it's pretty expensive food.  Yet we can all reasonably presume that these fillers and byproducts probably aren't that expensive to source.  What's worse is that this food can cause serious health problems like diabetes due to the ridiculously high amount of carbohydrates (aka sugars).  The guaranteed analysis on the Hill's website indicates this food is composed of 43.2% carbohydrates.  That's completely inappropriate for the nutritional needs of cats.<br /><br />I was lucky to "see the light" before my cat developed any serious health problems from this food.  My cats symptoms on Science Diet were fairly mild, but still concerning - she got fatter and fatter, she was inactive, her coat was dull, and she pooped a lot.  The first food I switched her to was Taste of the Wild Rocky Mountain Formula, which is a grain-free, high protein diet that costs about half the price of Science Diet.  The first 8 ingredients of Taste of the Wild are chicken meal, peas, sweet potatoes, chicken fat, pea protein, potato protein, roasted venison, smoked salmon.  Obvious improvement over Science Diet's ingredients.  My cat loved it, started losing weight, more activity, coat became shiner, and there were litter box benefits as well (less poo because she was no longer eating filler that her body couldn't process).  I absolutely feel Taste of the Wild is an amazing value for grain-free cat food and a vastly superior product compared to Science Diet and most other commercial cat foods.<br /><br />A few months ago I found Orijen cat food and decided to switch again.  The first 8 ingredients of Orijen are fresh boneless chicken, chicken meal, fresh boneless salmon, turkey meal, fresh chicken liver, herring meal, russet potato, chicken fat.  Now doesn't the Orijen ingredient list make the Science Diet ingredients above even more laughable and sad?  After feeding Orijen and a bit of high-quality canned food every day (Tiki Cat or Nature's Variety Instict), my 4 year old cat has practically become a kitten again.  She plays every day and is the picture of lean, bright-eyed, happy feline health.  Changing my cat's diet from Science Diet to a diet appropriate for felines has completely transformed my cat in less than 6 months!<br /><br />There is so much information about feline health out there and so many holistic foods to choose from now.  I strongly believe that anyone who currently feeds Science Diet would feel immediately compelled to switch foods after doing 20-30 minutes of research.  Please do.
496	3	This dried cantaloupe was soft and sweet.  It tasted good but no way did it taste like a real cantaloupe.  If you want a soft, moderately sweet, easy to carry treat, this if fine -- just don't expect cantaloupe flavor.
497	3	This package of Marley coffee contains a bunch of "pods" designed for pod coffee makers. Look them up and boggle at the prices. I do not have one so my first try was with my French press - the purest way of making coffee. I put one pod into it and poured in a large cupful of almost boiling water. After poking it around for a while and leaving it to sit, I got a blackish coffee which tasted a bit weak.<br /><br />For my second attempt I cut open two pods and emptied the ground coffee into the press. The resulting coffee was quite strong, but as a quasi-European (English) that's the way I like it.<br /><br />What to say about the flavor? It was mild (no harshness) and fairly pleasant. The coffee in Denny's restaurants is better though.
498	5	First, after trying all the mainstream formulas for my infant who spit up a lot about an hour after every feeding, we decided to give this a shot. She has nearly quit spitting up now.  She has put back on weight and is doing very well.<br />Second, With amazon subscribe and save, this is actually cheaper than the mainstream brands.
499	5	We thought the little guy's eyes would bug out when he saw not one, but FOUR cartons of puffs lined up on the counter. The color does bleed a little, so take that slight mess factor into account, but as far as we can tell our baby eats these things up like crack.
500	5	I absolutely love Pop Chips.  Cheddar is my favorite, but I thought I'd try these cause I like Parmesan too.  Just a word of caution....you'd better like garlic if you buy these because the garlic flavor definitely overwhelms the Parmesan flavor. All in all, these are great chips if you're watching your weight.  They are crispy and flavorful and much lower calories than regular chips.
501	1	The first split second after popping one of these in to my mouth wasn't so bad. Then reality set in. The taste that overcame my mouth was honestly the worst I think I've ever experienced. I can't even describe it. I immediately spit it out and promptly tossed the two packages I bought. Yuk!
502	2	If you want applesauce with a bit of carrot flavoring, this is the one for you. If you're expecting carrot puree, skip it.<br /><br />On the other hand, the price is pretty good for an organic product.
503	2	Let me start by saying this is not really bad jerky.  I took issue to two of the descriptions on the bag.  The first is that this in my opinion is not "HOT".  One would thing that Habanero jerky would at least elicit some type of heat in the mouth, tears, etc.  I did not find that to be the case & was quite disapointed.  I also do not believe this jerky to be very "tender".  The first two pieces I ate almost have the consistency of shoe leather & were very tough to chew through.  I have had purchased more tender jerky at Dollar General.  I will not be buying this again.
504	5	I have purchased Teas' Tea Pure Green tea for several years.  It is very refresing and has a nice, clean taste.  And, best of all, it is unsweetened!  The Green White tea is wonderful also.
505	5	Loved Lingonberry jam.  I first heard of it on Dr. Oz show and it's health qualities.  Our house serves it on toast for breakfast or a tablespoon in a morning smoothie. Great product.
506	4	I've tried other low-carb, sugar-free spreads/preserves/jams in the past, and I've hated them all. I remember buying Steel's cause a slew of low-carbers recommended it,and I ended up throwing out the jars I got. Horrible. Chemically.<br /><br />This actually made me stop and go, "Wow, this is pleasant."<br /><br />Let's face it, it's not regular, sugar-laden preserves with that thick, luxurious texture. But it's also only 20 cals per tablespoon and doesn't spike your sugar. If you have diabetes, Metabolic Syndrome, insulin issues, or are just a low-carb dieter (or dieter in general), this line of preserves is worth checking out.<br /><br />The Lowdown: I first used it on plain old toast over Smart Balance (I love the combo of fat spread with sweet spread, whether it's cream cheese and grape jelly or butter and jam.) It was very nice. The spread is thinner than I expect preserves to be--like a thickish fruit coulis, fruit puree, sort of thing. The taste is very fruity, apricotty, with an acidic edge. That's the reason I removed a star--the thinnish texture and slightly overacidic bite. However, I don't want to exaggerate either. It was a good flavor and a nice addition to breakfast. Also nice over low-fat waffles and pancakes, if you go for that sort of thing.<br /><br />I want to try the strawberry and blueberry, and I foresee that this might become a staple in my pantry. Finally, a lower carb, sugar-free preserve that I can enjoy.<br /><br />Update: I'm switching my rating to 5 stars. I'm just enjoying this more and more. Maybe my spring allergies affected my perception of the flavor, cause since my congestion eased, this tastes BETTER. I'm almost done with the jar and next time will stock up with 3. Yum.
507	5	These have a great combination of salt and vinegar which makes neither aspect overwhelming. They are insanely addictive and they go well with dried fruits like raisins to give some contrast to the salt. They are also high in fiber which makes up for their fat content to some extent.
508	3	I prefer the lighter blends, but I love my SENSEO!!!
509	5	I eat Coco Wheats 5 days a week, I make it the night before and eat it before work.  I love it and it's very healthy.
510	5	I have been buying this food locally but began to have a hard time fInding it. I searched online and it was a little more cost effective. My pups seem to love this food.
511	5	This is the best tea I have ever tasted at home.  The flavors are blended perfectly.  I like to fill a cup with ice then do a quick brew with the Keurig Machine.  No need to add sugar or cream.  I just wish I could find a comparable decaf so I could have an excellent nighttime cup of tea before sleeping.
512	5	It's great to be able to order Altoids Spearmints on line because they are often hard to find in stores and they're my favorite.  The price is better than locally too.  I would have given this company 5 stars but they sent me the wrong product.  They  were very good at correcting the problem in a timely fashion.  I'll be ordering again!
513	5	As in my previous review regarding dry Natural Balance...it was recommended by our vet because it is an outstanding, high quality, human grade food, with zero harmful ingredients.  Would highly recommend this brand of dog food.
514	5	I have no problem with Tully's Coffee or any of the coffees presented by Amazon.  I have a problem with ordering coffee through Amazon. The one time I ordered coffee it took forever and a day to arrive.  So I decided that made no sense when there are other websites that get the coffee delivered to your door much faster than Amazon can.
515	5	If you liked flavored coffees, this one has a hint of coconut to it.  This is my favorite coffee by far. I look forward to my first cup every morning.
516	4	This is a product that we will use again as it was a quick way to create a drink that satisfied the need for a casual cup of refreshment.
517	4	My periodic trip to costco (2-5x a year) happened 2 weeks after I got this from amazon<br />Slim jims from amazon:<br />firm, snap present, mail ordered<br /><br />slim jims from costco:<br />Slightly cheaper, over 100ct, some soft, snap varied, weaved thru lines of people at local costco.<br /><br />Both boxes were recently packaged. Only a little disappointed that the price was lower locally (until you account for gas and time).
518	5	The french vanilla decaf tea is an excellent full body tea that makes two cups. I have been purchasing this tea from Bigalow for years and am now happy that i can purchase this through Amazon
519	5	I paid the same amount for just one bottle of the hemp protein somewhere else...before I found it on Amazon.<br /><br />The Amazon ones do not come with the scoop though, but luckily I had saved mine.
520	3	My son loves all the food by earths best but would like to mention that it's way cheaper buying in store than amazon. Amazon charges 2 - 3$ more than stores.
521	3	I grew up with this movie.  At first I thought it had no plot, and was just a series of gross random events where Beetlejuice does bad stuff.  Now I realize that it does have a plot, and a very good one.  I don't recall any other movie where ghosts have trouble trying to scare living people out of a house and have to hire another ghost who claims to be an expert.  However, after this set-up happens, THAT'S when the movie becomes a series of gross random events where Beetlejuice does bad stuff.<br /><br />Whenever someone mentions Beetlejuice, I think of nothing else but all the weird stuff that's in it.  For instance, when the ghosts try to leave the house, they wind up in some crazy desert place where giant sandworms threaten to eat them.  The movie doesn't do a great job of explaining where this place is, but I think it's the planet Saturn.  Needless to say, since the ghosts can't leave their house, it definitely motivates them to scare away the living people moving in (a bunch of weirdos by the way, so that provides some extra incentive)<br /><br />Then there's the lost souls room, the guy stretching out his head to look like some sort of chicken, the shrimp cocktail turning into hands, Beetlejuice living in a model of the city, the chalk-drawn door opening up to a portal, and the moving art statues.  This movie is just flat-out bizarre.  There's so much that's packed into it.<br /><br />But its kind of a downer that the afterlife is shown as some kind of overly-administrative going to and fro, where you have to read a handbook, wait in an office, talk to a case worker, and do all other kinds of boring things.<br /><br />Here's the kicker.  I work in a funeral home, and this movie STILL grosses me out.  Walking dead folks are all over the place.  Some sawn in half, others flattened by a truck, and Beetlejuice himself looks to have some kind of mild skin decomposition.  But by far the scene that's hardest to stomach is the seance.  The ghosts are summoned in their wedding outfits only to grow older and older until they start to fall apart.  I should be thankful that they weren't shown as green and bloated throughout the whole movie, since drowning's the thing that killed them.<br /><br />This is one of the most original and disgusting films you'll ever see.  I think everybody should see it once, just to see how bizarrely creative it is.  Obviously a whole heck of a lot of work went into it.  Beetlejuice himself made me laugh quite a bit, with lines like, "Attention K-Mart shoppers!" but he sure did gross me out a lot too.<br /><br />I kind of wish Burton would have stayed away from the Halloween type movies and did more stuff like Pee-Wee's Big Adventure.  I've been wanting to see Big Fish for a while, but I heard its not very good.
522	5	I love this product.  I have tried multiple pastas in my pasta fagioli soup,  this is the best substitute for tubetti. Great in all soups from chicken noodle to vegetable.  Nice texture.<br />BUT WHAT IS REALLY COOL IS USING IT TO MAKE A GLUTEN FREE SPAGHETTI-O'S.  My daughter recently had both a tonsillectomy followed by placement of extensive orthodontia appliances.  So I wondered if it would work for a GF spag-O.  It was a huge hit, will definitely use for school lunches.  Place in boiling water, stir frequently (to get through the sticky/clumping phase), return to boil, boil for a few minutes then turn to low to medium heat and allow water to cook down (just like many brands of mac & cheese).  Then add spaghetti sauce.  It is always great to duplicate something that other kids can eat.
523	5	Refreshing Mint Revitalize Tea - I love it so much, I cannot tell you how much I love it!!!  This refreshing, minty, delicious tea is awesome.  It hits the spot.  It goes well with lots of foods, as well as by itself.  It is strong and minty - just perfect.<br /><br />I put a teabag or two in a glass of water.  The tea is strong, so before the drink is finished, I have to add more water.  It is perfect and delicious.  I don't usually put sugar in my tea, but for those people who do, sugar would be nice.  I usually just drink my tea straight.  I love tea with most all of my foods.<br /><br />Cornbread and ice tea is my favorite combination - even this minty tea goes good with cornbread.  In fact, it goes good with almost any food.<br /><br />Just a glass of tea, or a glass of tea with a brownie or cookie also is a wonderful combination.  This minty tea goes with almost everything, from cornbread to brownies.<br /><br />I am not usually a hot tea drinker.  I usually drink mine cold or iced.  But I know lots of people drink their tea hot.  This minty tea would be really awesome if it were hot.  Hot, minty tea sounds perfect and soothing and warm and even healing.<br /><br />I am so grateful that I got to find out about this tea.  I love it so much, and now you can bet it will be a regular in my kitchen cupboards.  Now that I know about it, there is no separating me from it.
524	5	We have used Miracle Whip for years on sandwiches and salads and are grateful to Kraft for manufacturing this product. It adds a refreshing taste that has never gotten tiresome even after decades of use!<br /><br />At our house we are never without a supply of Miracle Whip. One of my favorites is a sandwich composed of whole wheat bread topped first with Miracle Whip on both sides followed by Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter on one side and either bananas or sharp cheddar cheese slices on the other. To me that is sandwich heaven! I know, that combination might sound unlikely to some of you but in this case beauty is in the taste buds of the eater! If you like peanut butter and bananas I think you'll find the Miracle Whip is a tasty addition to the mix!<br /><br />One of the beauties of Miracle Whip is its adaptability; it works well and adds flavor and zest to almost any fanciful combination of ingredients one can imagine.<br /><br />If you enjoy a sandwich or a salad now and then, Miracle Whip can be a tangible asset to your list of favorite foods.
525	5	My husband and I went on a low-carb diet to lose weight last year. Once we were done losing, I started looking for good foods to help us maintain our progress. This came up on Amazon, but I was very hesitant...having tried every grocery-store-version of reduced-carb or reduced-calorie pasta, my "pasta-snob" husband has not been a fan of egg pasta in the past. The plain (egg) Carba-Nada Fettuccine is Fantastic! He had NO CLUE it was healthier than regular pasta, and in fact, asked me where I'd gotten it because it tasted really good. A few weeks ago, some very good family friends were in town, and we had plans to get together for dinner so we brought some of this pasta with sauteed shrimp and a light lemon-parmesan sauce. These friends are super-foodies and career restauranteurs including an amazing Italian restaurant. They loved(!) it, too!<br /><br />Note: Even if you're not on a low-carb diet, check the nutrition info. This pasta is a lot healthier (my opinion based on the stats) than the other dry pastas we used to buy, compared apples-to-apples...even compared to whole grain / whole wheat pastas! Here's an example:<br />Al Dente Caba-Nada Egg Fettuccine v. "Brand Name" Whole Wheat High Fiber Thin Spaghetti<br />Serving Size: 2 oz (56g) dry<br />Calories: 140 v. 210 (That's a 50% difference!)<br />Total Fat: 1g v. 1.5g<br />Total Carbohydrate: 24g v. 41g<br />Dietary Fiber: 6g v. 5g<br />Sugars: 0g v. 2g<br />Protein: 12g v. 7g<br /><br />The ONLY negatives are: (1) If you run out, you can't just run to the store to grab more (I haven't found it anywhere in our area), and (2) it's a little pricey compared to other dry pasta, but it's still downright *cheap* to make a meal for my family with this pasta.<br /><br />It's now on our Amazon Subscribe-&-Save list so we never run out. I'm back today to order some other flavors. Can't wait to give them a try!
526	5	I was introduced to this great product by a vet when our previous dog was 12. He lived to 16 and I truly believe that this product extended his life by a few months or more. We now give it to our new little guy and he loves it. It is great for their joints and coat as well as their general health. Great product!!
527	3	Considering the price, this is a decent soup, but please don't put the name of my home state on the can. There is probably a gram or two of crab meat on average in a can of this soup, and it's usually all chopped up to the point where you can't even bite into it. We don't take that in MD. Real Maryland crab soup is probably 10% crab by weight and features chunks of crab you can bite into and taste the love. This is vegetable soup stirred in crab meat.<br /><br />4 stars when it's $1 a can, 3 stars for &lt; $2.
528	5	This is the only gluten free spaghetti that my son eats.  I like the mix of grains in it.
529	1	I have been drinking dark magic for a long time, this in no way compares, its horrible, watery. I should have been suspicious when the coffee pods were floating free in the box rather than packed in the company box. I thought the first cup was an accident but today it tastes just as bad. Very disappointing and no return policy. Don't buy it its junk.
530	5	I was skeptical at first when I found this item on Amazon, but I bought it out of blind faith and VERY happy with my choice.  The last brand of agave I bought was bitter but this brand is very light and sweet.  The best part about it was that it was VERY inexpensive and a bulk order.
531	5	I've tried a lot of protein shakes and frankly, most of them have tasted like sand. One even made me gag. This one actually tastes good. It's not something I would crave because of the taste, but for a protein shake it's really very good! I recommend it!
532	4	I have been buying these for quite some time now - they were recommended by our vet, and our dog simply loves them. They do a fine job of keeping her teeth clean, occupying her while we eat dinner, and best of all they don't seem to have any ill effects on her digestive tract (which is always a concern of mine with rawhide products). They seem well-made and thoughtfully produced. My sole gripe is, as others have mentioned, the uniformity of their size. Our puppy is only 50lbs, but I've found myself having to order the XL size package to ensure the bulk of the package is reasonably sized chews. I originally ordered the normal size package, but the ratio of S:M:L chews was definitely skewed in favor of S:M. Even with the XL size package, where the ratio is skewed M:L, we still get a number of very small chews - chews so small our dog can swallow them nearly whole after just a few minutes of chewing. This creates a serious choking hazard, and I sometimes find myself just throwing these tiny ones away. Obviously the size issue hasn't stopped me from buying the product (I'm very happy with it), but to earn a 5-star review some better size control would be required.
533	5	Nutiva organic hemp seeds are fresh tasting and have a very nice flavor. We enjoy sprinkling them on salads or just eating them plain. We have these ordered through subscribe and save through Amazon and enjoy their fast shipping for a good price.
534	5	These are adorable and the perfect size for our tea party themed bridal shower.<br /><br />We are planning to use them as our favours paired with a mini honey dipper and mini glass canisters of herbal tea.  They were extremely well packaged and very cute.<br /><br />We are planning to create little favour tags that say "Meant to Bee," "Love as Sweet as Honey," or "Love is Brewing"... I can't wait to use them!!
535	2	I saw this ice cream on the Today Show this morning.  It was featured as an item to satisfy sweet cravings without adding extra calories.  I purchased the chocolate peanut butter one and it tastes like a protein shake.  I think you are better off getting a lower calorie frozen treat such as Lifeway's Frozen Kefir.  It is 360 calories for the whole pint, but who needs to eat the whole pint anyway?  It also has probiotics in it.  Less calories in this case is less flavor.
536	5	This is the only coffee creamer that I will drink in my coffee. I use about one can every two weeks or so. I love it.
537	5	Watch out Snapple, there is a new Juice in town... I was a little taken back how great of a juice this is. After reading the ingredients I was very skeptical. Then I tried it. It is absolutely the best tasting fruit juice drink, loaded with a ton of good ingredients on the market, hands down. It very rich and satisfying without feeling overly full. My two kids love the juice and as a parent, i'm very happy to give it to them. The most impressive thing is the Calorie content, most drinks in this calorie range come up short, not with Bai. It's full flavored and Very satisfying. Five stars.
538	4	My son loved these for about a month, so we went through lots of them.  They take 20 seconds to fix, but they're very mushy.  Makes me wonder how healthy they are.
539	5	These chips are delicious and good for you.  I buy the small bags and they are just right to eat with your lunch or for a snack.  I would recommend them to anyone who loves chips but doesn't like all the fat and calories.
540	5	This is, quite simply, the best hot cocoa I've ever tasted.  Being a self-admitted chocoholic, I've tasted a LOT of hot cocoa.  I even prefer Nestle's Double Chocolate Meltdown to pricier choices like Godiva or Ghirardelli.  This cocoa is smoother and more chocolaty than anything else I've found out there.  I highly recommend it.
541	5	I chose to try this tea as a help with water retention and other reviews suggested dandelion helps!  Although a different taste, I enjoyed the kind of roasted taste and often added another type of tea to the brew for added flavor (green tea, peppermint, ginger, and lemon all compliment well).  I followed the suggestion of using two tea bags per cup as I enjoy a stronger tasting tea and you could water it down if it was too strong.  I have not really paid attention to any benefits, but at the same time have not had any side affects (have noticed less water retention; ankles mainly).  I enjoy this tea hot or cold.
542	4	Well  I have read some of the reviews to the "New " Good Earth Sweet & Spicy Tea  and I can say that even with the "temporary" addition of the artifical ingredient  The Flavor and Strength is still there .<br /><br />  Last September 2011 I ordered directly from Good Earth Teas in California a whole Lb in bulk ( Huge Bag ) the Caffeinated  Sweet & Spicy Tea and enjoyed it fully .<br /><br />  I just bought the New TATA Enterprise purple box Sweet & Spicy Caffeinated  Tea and it still taste Great !!  I got a good deal at a local market for the 18 count box for only $ 2.99  per box  so I bought 7 of them  :)<br /><br />  It is great that on Amazon , if I want to get it delivered to my door I can .
543	3	My rating is based on the condition of the product when I recieved it.  Of the case of 12 cans I had ordered, 4 of them had serious dents.  I sent an email about the packaging but received no response.  I would give the product itself at least a 4 rating.
544	5	I adore this seasoning. Why on earth has it disppeared from the grocery stores? I was excited to see it on Amazon. Twelve cans was a bit much, but I HAD to have this stuff so I'll just store it .. somewhere. I use it on meat, chicken, fish, eggs, veggies, popcorn.. I use this instead of salt and pepper.
545	5	I have two cats, one 6 and one 2 years old. Both are indoor cats in excellent health. I saw the negative review and talked to my vet about it. I've also asked a number of veterinary professionals what to feed my cats and they all answer the same thing: Science Diet. Sure, you'll see stories of how one person's cat had issues, but even if that's 100% true, it's 1 case out of millions. Science and fact aren't based on someone's experience.<br /><br />So my point is, I love my cats and I'm very concerned about their health. I trust people who actually have medical degrees and experience with a wide range of animals. My only caution is do not fall for some hype or scare tactic that recommends some unproven or untested food or some fad diet for your pet. Don't listen to me, don't listen to the negative review. ASK YOUR VET what they recommend, and follow their instructions. My guess is you'll end up buying the Science Diet anyhow.
546	1	Sad to see that these are made in China. China's pet products have horrible backgrounds, you can easily look that up anywhere. They don't treat their animals humanely and they have been caught using dead dogs to feed to dogs. If you love and respect animals, don't buy pet products from China. I like American made products because it keeps jobs here as well.
547	2	Like other reviewers I found these to be way to salty. They do not need to add extra salt when cheese already has enough on it's own. If they change the recipe I will be more than happy to try again but not the way they are now.
548	5	First of all, the sizes vary a bit, which in fact I love especially if you have different sized pups. Most of them are very thick with some smaller sized mixed in.  Love that they are grass fed and hormone/antibiotic free. This is EXTREMELY important to me!!! The length was near perfect on every one. The smell was minimal. My dog loved them and I recently purchased more. The price is out of this world!!!! I was paying over $7.00 for one, locally. Great product, great price, great value!
549	5	As a post WLS patient, I need to use protein supplements. This delicious protein allows me to fulfill my dietary needs while tasting like it came from my favourite cafe! A definite must try.
550	5	My puppy loves the stuff.  His poo is proper consistency since switching, his coat is beautiful, and he treats the stuff like, well, a treat.  Can't wait to try the other flavors with him.<br /><br />The ingredients list is tough to beat for the price.<br /><br />-Jim
551	5	The Vet recommended these because they are really natural and healthy treats for your dog. Give one of the best treats. It is moist and juicy and smells good that even I want to try it, too!. But use sparingly because they do run out fast and so is your cash!<br /><br />but I come to amazon because I know I can save $2-3 compare to those retail stores.<br /><br />my 10 pound Shih Tzu gets a treat every day after she takes an evening walk.  A bag last about 1 month for my dog.
552	5	My grandson sucked this down so fast I thought he was going to get a headache.  He loves it and my daughter has started buying them regularly now.  She said they travel well and she doesn't have to worry about breaking jars to get veggies into her baby when they travel.  Actually he has these mostly at home.
553	5	I was skeptical about paying for this bottled water, but once I tasted it, I was hooked for life! It is delicious and is the ultimate thirst quencher! I do wish you guys sold at costco so I could fill my refrigerator!
554	5	Have been on the search for the perfect dark chocolate to keep in the house for a dessert treat that a nutritionist would approve of.  My son gave me this for Christmas and love the flavor and texture.  It's not too bitter, has even rich flavor and texture.  Absolutely love it.  I read what reviewer Theo said about not having whole milk in dark chocolate and will keep my eyes open for dark chocolate that doesn't have it.  In the meantime, will enjoy this as a treat.
555	4	No complaints about the chips, they're great. However the box arrived from UPS half open and when I opened it completely, I found one chip bag had exploded and all the other 23 bags were crushed or semi-crushed. So much for that! Not blaming Amazon or UPS but next time this happens, I will return the order.
556	5	Good brew - very low acid. Great service and price. I love this blend.  It's the best. Sign me up!
557	5	I choose to eat multigrain pasta because it is better for one's health than the traditional pasta.
558	5	This is very high quality cocoa powder, with high cocoa butter content.  It makes excellent hot chocolate, brownies, mochas, and frosting.<br /><br />It is not Dutch process, so it is suitable for most uses which do not explicitly call for Duch process cocoa.<br /><br />It ships in a durable and resealable plastic bag, and stays fresh and dry for months.
559	5	Got this for Christmas, I'm addicted.  Just ordered another two boxes. Coffee tastes great, gives out an aroma that fills the whole house. I've gotten great  reviews on my coffee since I started using my new coffee machine.
560	3	When I found nothing in the product info to tell me if the beans were ground or whole, I called to ask.  The CS rep checked and told me they were ground, but couldn't tell me what type of grind.  Imagine my surprise to receive 5 pounds of whole UN-GROUND coffee beans.  THE PRODUCT IS FINE.  YOUR INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRODUCT AND YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS LACKING.
561	4	Congratulations to the folks at Coconut Secret for offering an alternative to soy sauce, tamari and Bragg's. Those who are allergic to soy, like my husband, or just prefer to avoid soy will be thrilled to be able to enjoy sushi and other Asian dishes again. A little bit sweeter than the typical soy products and rather pricey, but the possibilities outweigh the downsides.
562	5	We have used this product for over 2 years and have found it to be the best as far as quality and flavor are concerned, without the bitterness found in Starbucks or the burnt taste of Dunkin Donuts restaurant coffee.<br /><br />JJ
563	5	Everything AmeriColor that I have purchased works great! I was looking for some lighter tone colors, everything I had was pretty bright. These sheen colors are light with a pretty sheen, it's great! Thank you!
564	5	Become an instant gourmet with these delightful oils! Okay, perhaps you won't be an overnight sensation but your culinary experiments are sure to take a step in the right direction thanks to these fantastic oils by La Tourangelle.<br /><br />Proper oils are essential for flavor, health and proper food preparation technique but our local grocery stores leaves a lot to be desired in terms of selection. Finding a half decent olive oil was a chore so you can imagine the difficulty associated with more obscure oils.<br /><br />After reading the health benefits associated with Grape seed oil, I first ordered a three pack of that as well as the sesame. Both quickly became household favorites. The sesame has a slight sweet hint that my spouse finds perfect for apparently everything. He now uses it exclusively for organic popcorn (odd but it really tastes terrific) to salads and homemade bread. It's light with a slight sweetness. Absolutely delicious at a very competitive price. Wonderful addition to a kitchen searching for something other than olive oil.<br /><br />We've also tried the Grape, Sesame, Walnut and Almond...to date, have been very pleased with all of them. Wonderful selection.
565	5	This tuna is very tasty right out of the can.  The oil is light and just the right amount.  It's not drowning in oil like most.  I tried this after reading the reviews on here and they're right.  It's like a whole different type of fish compared to local store brands.  Definitely recommend trying this tuna.
566	4	I love having these on hand to pack in lunches, or to satisfy the urge to crunch.  Probably not as healthy as a salad , but more nutritionally sound than regular potato chips.
567	5	It seemed like our dogs were getting tired of the same old thing for dinner, so I did some research and found this Wellness brand dog food. What I liked about it was the lack of by-products and cereals. Our dogs love the taste of this food and there is never any left in their bowls. It is a well baqlanced food that good for them also and having it shipped directly to my door saves us a trip to the pet stores. I count on Amazon for the best products.
568	4	Wasn't expecting much from this premium green tea. Although I drink tea almost daily and enjoy a wide range of standard brands (Bigelow, Twinings, etc.; some product from Chinatown, as well as tea from companies with more pricey and custom blends such as Marriage Freres, Republic of Tea, Harney & Sons, and some blends from online tea merchants), I can't say I'm an "expert." I just know what I like and enjoy.<br /><br />And I really enjoyed this tea, once I stopped expecting it to taste like a typical green tea. As others have noted, this is not a generic-type green tea. Thanks to the addition of lemon grass, lemon balm herb and verbena leaves, this is, to my palate, a more flavorful and "spicey" green tea.<br /><br />Now if you aren't familiar with, or don't like lemon or verbena, you may not care for this green tea. But if you do like either lemon or verbena, this is a delight. For me, it's a nice addition to my collection of "special" teas for relaxation and downtime...and bad weather.<br /><br />You can't always tell from the aroma as to whether or not you'll like a tea. But if you like that first whiff when you open the bag, you're generally on the track to a positive tasting experience. Not only did I like the aroma (I was even thinking "Gee, can I put these in my closet to keep it fresh?") but it smelled really fresh. For those of you who don't drink tea very often, you may not recognize the difference between old/stale teas and those that are younger and fresher. (Real people word choices here. As I said, I'm not a tea expert so I don't have the specific vocabulary to describe this aspect.)<br /><br />This product has the hallmark of a good tea: You can drink it "as is" without the benefit of any sweetner, lemon or milk. But some of you may prefer adding to it. You can also enjoy it without having to eat anything else. (Some teas just seem to "demand" crackers or something to go with them.)<br /><br />If I close my eyes while sipping, I can imagine being in one of the better tea parlors here in New York City (Think Bosie, Harney & Sons or Radiance in midtown). It's that kind of flavor but the cost is far more affordable than the by-the-ounce prices at such venues for their green teas.<br /><br />Haven't had a chance to drink it with a variety of food or snack items, but I suspect this could go with either moderately sweet or savory items.<br /><br />I also suspect this tea would be incredibly refreshing in hot weather when made as iced tea as its flavor has the lemony "fresh" bite I like in the summer and it would hold up with the addition of ice.<br /><br />A lot of people think you can't really get quality tea in a bag. And it's true that there is often a significant difference in the end product when you brew with a bag versus loose tea. However, in this case, I think the bag holds its own.
569	5	These slim cookies are perfect for a light, tasty treat.  Crunchy, nutty, sweet and spicy (but not-too-sweet or spicy with chewy bits of ginger), all natural, and low-fat.  Perfect with a cup of tea!
570	5	This vinegar is so awesome that I used to pick it up when I visited San Francisco.  I'm so glad it's available online -- it's heavenly on a simple greens salad.
571	4	We gave this to our 4 week old puppies, to get them started on a food after nursing from their mom was coming to an end. The smell was strong, which is why I gave it a 4 star, but the pups LOVED the food. It definately didn't take long to wean them off their Mom and onto dog food. It was also a thick canned food, which made it SLIGHTLY less of a mess after feedings.
572	5	Finally found tuna in oil again! These have The flavor we are used to having in our salads! Thanks! Signed for the auto ship also.
573	4	At first, using PB2 was confusing as the ratio of powder to water in the directions gave me a very dry crumbly mess. As I experimented, I found adding more water, a little at a time, gave me the consistency of peanut butter that I desired. I like that the fat is almost all removed and when prepared, can be used just like regular peanut butter with much less calories. A treat for me as I love peanut butter but can enjoy it more so using PB2.<br /><br />I did remove one star as I'm not happy that sugar is added to this product (wish it was an artificial sweetener or nothing at all).
574	1	I tried using these filters in a Presto percolator. Even with less coffee, only 4 scoops, the brew basket overflowed and washed a lot of the grounds out the top. With other pots they may work but not the Presto 12 cup. Too bad - the wrap around filters are a pain.<br /><br />Amazon only sent 1 pack of 100 filters. When notified they refunded the money for the filters they didn't send. This worked out in my favor because of the above. I am glad I don't have 2400 filters that don't work in the pot - 100 is plenty. I bought so many because a friend, who must have a very different percolator said they work for him. He almost got 2300 filters for Christmas!
575	5	I am so excited to see Amazon offering the Van Houtte k cups. They are by far my favorites. This one is my husbands favorite. I am not big on the fruity flavored coffes, but I love the way this one makes the whole room smell. I was surprised that I like this one. These coffees are a great combination of flavor and a medium bodied coffee. I have tried five of their flavors and all of them taste exactly like what they are supposed to taste like. The 5 I have tried are the raspberry truffle of course and Creme Caramel (tastes like those little square caramels you see at Halloween), Spicy Mayan ( My favorite chocolate and cinnamon mix), pecan praline and creme brulee. I am so happy I no longer have to spend more to stock these coffees. My house is never out of the Raspberry Chocolate truffle and the Spicy Mayan. They have the best and most unique flavors. If you like flavored coffee that is full of flavor and yet has a nice smooth medium bodied coffee taste, then these are a must try. I highly recommend the Van Houtte line of k cups.
576	3	I am not a coffee drinker, but my husband has a travel cup attached to his hand. This is his review:<br /><br />The coffee was okay. Very flavorful.<br />My preferred coffee flavor is bolder along the Italian/ Colombian lines so this having a subtle hint of flower flavor was very different.<br />I know this will be a big hit to some coffee drinkers but it is not for me.
577	5	I have been drinking Lifeboat tea for years -- every afternoon without fail. I've made converts of my family. It's a delicious tea with a rich mellow flavor that does not get bitter. It makes delicious iced tea, as well, as it holds up to the ice and lemon. Most of us don't steep it too long, but I have friends who like it that way, too. I just delivered a few Lifeboat teabags to my British hairdresser, who gave it her approval, as well. I give Lifeboat tea to all my tea-drinking friends with hopes they'll enjoy it as much as I do. A percentage of the price you pay is always donated to families of fishermen in Great Britain who've been lost at sea. Those of us living in the fishing communities on Cape Ann -- Gloucester, Ma -- understand the perils fishermen are up against.
578	5	I've loved this Hersey Chocolate since when I was little. It's unfortunate that it is not available in Canada.  Every time  I need one I have to cross border. Unbeatable!
579	4	What is it about these puffs that babies love so much?  Both my kids could not get enough.  Currently, my 9 month old just loves them.  I like that they are organic and have less sugar than other brands, so thats why ive been a loyal Happy Baby buyer, even though i know several other brands are avilable.  I get the greens flavor.  I know there isnt much "green" in there, but every little bit counts, right?
580	5	I am an avid tea drinker. I have searched the tea community high and low for a robust decaf tea, and have finally found the one. The only decaf that truly tastes like a classic cup of tea.
581	1	Read the ingrediant list.  This has 640%!!! of the calories of regular frozen blueberries by weight.  High Fructose Corn Syrup, sunflower oil and "blueberry flavor" really don't belong in "All Natural" blueberries.<br /><br />Don't believe me, go to their website and look yourself.<br /><br />Here is what it says, "ingredients:  blueberries, high fructose corn syrup, malic acid, sunflower oil, natural blueberry flavor, citric acid. "<br /><br />All this realy is, is candy.
582	1	Thought I was getting a good deal on these K-cups...but this is the worst coffee we have ever had!  The taste is so strange and for it to be called Fog Chaser, I thought it would be strong.  It's not very weak...see through coffee.  Will never buy again.
583	2	I had tried the Betty Crocker GF Brownie mix and loved it, so I bought these without testing them first. Silly me... They must be eaten while still warm. If you wait too long, they develop a sandy texture and loose much of their flavor.<br /><br />Just the two of us, so I mix up a batch and roll them into balls. I refrigerate the balls until we feel like warm out of the oven cookies. Then I only bake as many as I know we will eat for that one treat time.
584	5	I have 2 brothers that are cats and they have had this food on and off their whole lives they love it.  It's healthy and at times hard to find at stores so I prefer to order it online.
585	4	These are a must have for syrups.  It makes measuring a lot easier and it eliminates a lot of mess rather than pouring right from the bottle.  My only complaint would be that it's nearly impossible to put a pump into a full bottle of syrup.  It has overflowed every time I have tried.  Other than that, they work great.  Just make sure to clean them regularly :)
586	3	I LOVE Nestle Rich Hot Cocoa and I was so excited to find it on Amazon for a reasonable price, but I was really disappointed with the condition of the cans once I got the box they came in opened. Two of the six cans I ordered were crushed on top and one can had a massive gash in it which caused some product to spill out during shipping. This was really disappointing as chocolate isn't cheap. I was also incredibly nervous about using the product not knowing if the gash was man-made or if it was the result of improper handling from the warehouse? Consumers cannot be too careful these days with past cases of product tampering. Overall, I was satisfied with the length of time it took for me to receive the product. I just wish the presentation would have been better. Canned foods should NEVER have holes or gashes in them and crushed cans are usually caused from poor packaging.
587	2	These looked so good but arrived crumbled, dry and stale.  A bit disappointed. I think their packaging needs to change to avoid this if shipped.
588	5	Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps taste yummy and rich. Five cookies contain only 130 calories.  Some of the ingredients used are natural organic unbleached wheat  flour, organic sugar, molasses, candied ginger, salt.  Cookies are crisp and full flavored.  Great for dessert, picnic, or a snack. Serve them up with a cold glass of milk--delicious!
589	1	I couldn't take two sips of this. Tastes like chewing on a plastic bag. I used to LOVE Zico in Tetrapak - what happened?? Now I have a case of this and don't know what to do with it!
590	4	I have been drinking espresso/latte for years. One "big" cup in the morning and I'm gone for the day! Of course I have tried many different beans from many different roasters. Although I like "Italian dark" this "blend" is very much alike in some ways: full, smooth with deep aroma and great "crema" on top. I believe, just like wine, coffee is each individuals own taste but, try this one for a smooth, powerful wake up! Also very satisfied with the brand for great packaging and fast delivery.
591	5	So far, this is my favorite blend of coffee. It has a delicious flavor. Bold but not overpowering. I will definitely be buying this again!
592	5	This is my first time with any green powders, been drinking it with juice for about 3 weeks and notice energy and skin improvement (had a bit of eczema on elbow that had tried everything to clear and is gone now).  I have just discovered that putting the powder into Simply Lemonade is WAY tastier...now problem drinking it at all.  Will definitely continue my subscription of this product.
593	5	I have two cats, one 6 and one 2 years old. Both are indoor cats in excellent health. I saw the negative review and talked to my vet about it. I've also asked a number of veterinary professionals what to feed my cats and they all answer the same thing: Science Diet. Sure, you'll see stories of how one person's cat had issues, but even if that's 100% true, it's 1 case out of millions. Science and fact aren't based on someone's experience.<br /><br />So my point is, I love my cats and I'm very concerned about their health. I trust people who actually have medical degrees and experience with a wide range of animals. My only caution is do not fall for some hype or scare tactic that recommends some unproven or untested food or some fad diet for your pet. Don't listen to me, don't listen to the negative review. ASK YOUR VET what they recommend, and follow their instructions. My guess is you'll end up buying the Science Diet anyhow.
594	5	They are so tasty it's hard to believe how healthy they are.  Great product for breakfast, snack or dessert. I have tried the other flavors, which are good, but this one to me is by far the best.
595	2	We usually cook our own dry beans, but sometimes you need something quick.  So, I always keep a few cans of beans on hand. We usually buy Westbrae Natural Vegetarian Organic Brand Beans at our local Co-Op, but I bought a can of this to try since it was on sale.<br /><br />The first impression was not great, but then odd bitter aftertaste and an earthy "dirt" sort of taste made us pause.  And then the texture - it was all wrong- there was something other than beans in our can, like roots or something... it was gross enough that I could only eat a few bites of mine.  My husband stopped at bite one. What a waste of money!<br /><br />I wanted to give this one star - but my husband said to give the company the benefit of the doubt - maybe not all cans are as bad as the one we bought. Either way, I'm not buying their beans again!
596	5	I am very happy with this product.  If you don't like the flavors, at least it is not much to swallow for the energy boost you gain!  With that said, the flavors are pretty good.
597	5	If you have a Nespresso<br />machine and want to save money, consider this product. If you<br />have problems<br />using it, write or<br />call<br />them. They are going to help<br />you!
598	5	These are so tasty! Just the perfect amount of sweetness! They are nicely brown around the edges, so delicious!
599	5	A perfect combination of bergamot and tea. Full bergamot flavor. the best Earl Grey tea I have had.
600	5	I'm no coffee aficionado but I know what doesn't suck, and this coffee doesn't. It works well in my stovetop espresso maker as well as in the ol' Bunn. When I use it in my French press it's pretty dreggy but I like it like that. Alls I can say is this coffee is bold and flavorful and has pretty much become my everday coffee.
601	5	Well, I suppose if you don't like spicy food, these might not be your thing. And if you don't like wonderfully tasty, crispy (and healthy!) snacks, they might not be your thing either!<br /><br />But I'm guessing you already passed these by if you fall into the former category, and I'm guessing not many people fit into the latter.<br /><br />My only complaint with these is that the wasabi coating seems to be slightly variable on them, as in I'll have one piece that's moderately hot, and then another that's really not at all. These are horribly addictive too, so it's not like I can just eat a couple of them anyways! They're fairly healthy, which makes me not feel as bad about sucking down a whole pack, but my wallet is more of a limiting factor than my appetite on buying these damn things!<br /><br />In short, these are tasty but moderately spicy. If you like wasabi, you'll love them. If you like seaweed (in whatever form; seaweed salad, on/around your sushi, etc), you'll love them. If you think you hate seaweed since it sounds icky, I bet you'll still love them!
602	5	LOVE this product!  Wish it would come in a fat free version!  Delivery was great and it smells GREAT! YUMMY, delicious and my hubby enjoys it too!
603	5	I read a lot about Muscovado sugar for years and decided to order some for my Christmas baking.  I give away a lot of baked goodies as thank you gifts to friends, family and those who have helped and supported me and my family over the year, like my Vet and the hospital staff.  There is no comparison.  Everyone was asking what I did to the recipes to improve on already excellent products.  As I was making the doughs and batters, one taste told me that I was onto something great.  I'm not going back to regular sugars.  Muscovado is worth EVERY penny of the extra costs.  Try it once and you'll be hooked.  I am.  Just wish I had purchased it sooner.
604	5	Just what I was looking for tired of going to the store to pick these up and always being sold out! I love the flavor not so sweet and just right!! Thank you! and will be buying again!!
605	5	Like so many others, I had this tea on my first visit to Ireland.<br /><br />After my first cup, I thought, "this is pretty good!"<br /><br />After my second cup later, I thought, "this is pretty darn good."<br /><br />The next day I bought a box to take home.<br /><br />Then I started asking friends and co-workers to bring an extra suitcase on their trips to Ireland...<br /><br />Over the next 20 years I heard the same story from many others here, "I asked a friend to bring an extra suitcase..."<br /><br />I'm really happy that this tea is available here now, and my wife and I travel nowhere without bringing a sufficient supply of Barry's, as it really brightens our day in a way that is unmatched by any other tea (or coffee for that matter).<br /><br />This is the "tea bag" version, so some loose leaf tea drinkers may suspect that the bags are filled with floor sweepings, as seems to be the case with many other tea bags.<br /><br />Not so, this is the good stuff (although if you want the hassle, you can get this in loose-leaf).<br /><br />I prepare it in a Krups coffee maker (this and a few others have the correct water temperature), set a timer for 6 minutes in good water (Brita faucet filtered, which beats bottled Mountain Spring water for taste, really, and costs $0.10 per gallon).<br /><br />Don't follow my example and be led into a life-long addiction, stay away from this tea!<br /><br />:O)
606	5	I asked the breeder "why Canidae"? I never even heard of it. She told me that because German Shepards have sensitive stomachs and also prone to hip problems is why this product is so beneficial to their dogs. Ever since a puppy my dogs been on Canidae. I have tried others when I couldn't find Canadie, like now and noticed a differance in various ways. I am happy to see I can now buy the product online to get my dog back on tract.
607	5	Our family loves this ice tea and we drink it by the gallon.  Great time saver for making it with mix..  Best price for value when bought in bulk and very few stores carry the larger size.
608	2	I'm a huge fan of Newman's salad dressings, but this flavor was so bad that I had to return it.  It smells like lemon-scented furniture polish, and tastes like lime-flavored Crystal Light drink mix -- chemical-tasting and completely overpowering.  I love Newman's products and will continue to buy their other flavors, but I won't be buying this stuff ever again (unless they drastically change the recipe).
609	5	WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL PRODUCT.  I was so impressed with this product, I just wrote a letter to the company (S & M NuTec)that developed and make them, telling them how thrilled I am.  I've got 3 elderly dogs all on daily medications ( two are on oral chemotherapy, one on Thyroid, one takes Arthritis Medications and one is on Antibiotics)....and they actually LOOK FORWARD to getting their pills!!!  I started out giving them an empty pouch or two then the one with a pill in it....and after the 3rd day, I didnt need the empty pouchs.<br /><br />No more wasted, half dissolved pills or capsules found in corners, no more dragging them out from under the kitchen table, no more cleaning the pill syringe after every use, no more prying open jaws.  NO MORE PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS INFLICTED ON MY ELDERLY POOCHES ON A DAILY BASIS.<br /><br />I buy the LARGE size and cut them in half, then mold the pill around it, so I get 60 pieces out of the Large 30 chew bag.<br /><br />I see they now have Chicken available and will be ordering some of them too. THIS IS A MUST HAVE PRODUCT for Dog and Cat owners.
610	1	My kitten--now a hefty 11 pound slug--went through the same antics as the 1-star review written about Bean.<br /><br />I couldn't figure out why our Tiki was always hungry.  Why she got fat and lazy and was always panting, but never too satiated to turn up her nose at Science Diet.  She was always begging for it, every 4 hours.  And her litter-box smells, and the size of the poos--I swear, they were human-size!  I thought okay, she's a growing kitten, she must know more than I do about her nutritional needs, so I kept filling the bowl.  But she got so huge so fast that I knew something was wrong.<br /><br />So I did my research and learned all about sub-standard pet food, and what cats really need. It's not Science Diet, that's for sure!  Yet our local pound where I adopted Tiki insisted on keeping her on Science Diet, because "it's good for the cats and they love it". Hmmm.<br /><br />I began weaning our Tiki off Science Diet about 2 months ago.  It has been a long and tortuous change for both of us.  I have to put up with pitiful meowing all hours of the night.  Unfortunately I have to keep a small bag of Science Diet in the pantry (long story short: our other emaciated cat Tonga needs to have a small amount of Science Diet mixed in with her good Evo food to "fatten her up" with empty calories).<br /><br />You should see Tiki when she comes anywhere near the Science Diet bag of food.  She goes nuts, literally.  She yanks at the bag, tries to rip it open, drags it around the house in her teeth...one time she even bit through some plastic water bottles to try to get behind them and attack the Science Diet.<br /><br />When we began this process 2 months ago I switched to Innova Evo (timed feeding) along with various expensive wet foods, freely fed.  Evo is great for the cats (though Tonga, already a sleek looking cheetah-wannabee) lost weight on it; hence, the need to augment her food with fattening, empty-cal Science Diet.  On strictly Evo and wet food  our Tiki, too, has lost weight, but it has been gradual, as I can't do it too fast, because she is still a growing kitten at 10 months.<br /><br />Sorry for the jumble of writing, but you get the point: NO to Science Diet.
611	5	This is the only sesame oil I will use. The aroma, taste, and texture (it's not greasy...) makes the dish what it was intented to be! Where I live it is hard to find Kadoya Sesame Oil so I have to resort to ordering it off line. The 56 oz is only ideal if you cook ALOT...a little of this goes a long way...trust me!
612	5	Worth the price and trouble of buying them. Even if your not diabetic they will help you take sugar out of your diet.  These are by far NO regular diet cookies. There simply to good to pass up.  Get some.  I recommend it.
613	5	My 3 cats can't get enough of these treats. A great product at a great price AND fast shipping. What more can 3 cats ask for?
614	5	THis is so good for you and It tastes good too.<br />If you put it with orange juice you can't even tell the difference. definitely a must buy. Great for getting greatly needed nutrients in reluctant kids AND adults.<br /><br />IT HAS in 3 rounded teaspoons:<br />350mg of Magnesium<br />230mg of Calcium Carbonate<br />115mg of Potassium<br />290mg of Vit C<br />115IU of Vit D3<br />290mcg of Boron
615	3	I bought this because I felt I wasn't getting enough vegetable in my diet at college, and I'm sure that it has done a terrific job stuffing my system full of nutrients, but I am always hesitant to take it because of a few reasons.  First of all, as I'm sure must be expected, this powder (when mixed with water, of course) has a god awful taste. Thankfully, the drink doesn't taste all too bad in the moment, but the aftertaste leaves you looking remarkably like a cat wheezing out a hairball. This might be due to the fact that the powder doesn't dissolve fully into the water, and instead all sifts down to the bottom of the glass, such that when you reach the end of the drink you're literally drinking a gritty green sludge (even if you stir vigorously and then drink it immediately). The only other reason that I have any qualms with this product, is because you're forced to use so much water to mix it into, that you overload your stomach with liquid and it sloshes about for a surprisingly long time. This always leaves me feeling nauseated, and I always end up burping excessively and having the fight the urge to vomit.<br /><br />All in all, I'm happy this product exists, but I wish there was some way to make it dissolve more effectively, or simply taste ever so slightly better. I've heard that mixing in a packet of Emergen-C does wonders for the taste, and I've also considered mixing the powder into something like apple juice to help the taste.  In any case, I'd still consider it a worthwhile product with just a few understandable drawbacks.
616	4	I have 2 large breeds; a Tibetan Mastiff 2 years old and a Newfie 8 years old. I used to buy the old Sam's brand Lamb and Rice formula - which is a good food, but I always had to add something to it, like milk, broth, treats to make it palatable to the pups. This formula doesn't require anything but the kibble, and so treats remain treats instead of part of the meal.<br /><br />They both eat it up without any issues; no digestive problems.<br /><br />I originally found out about it through our dog trainer. She suggested it because my Newfie is a senior and is starting to have allergies - itchy skin. We live in the South and have 2 long haired large dogs who are prone to allergies. This has helped some, but I keep them on it because they do eat it and the ingredients are high quality.<br /><br />I started giving them Omega 3,6,9s and Biotin again. I used to do this over a year ago and they both had beautiful hair and skin. My TM has some itching, but not bad - gorgeous coat. The Newfie is miserable and I hope putting her back on the Omega's and Biotin will reverse the issues. Her hair and skin was great when she was on them before, I just wasn't 100% sure it was the vitamins that helped. I will know soon enough and post my findings. Just put them back on them, so it may take me 2 months to update. I have also tried other holistic approaches to helping her with her skin as well as Benadryl - they help some, but not enough.<br /><br />Won't be disappointed and you can't beat that delivery is free, no tax and it comes straight to your door - I enjoy that I do not have to lug the large bags around Sam's. :)
617	5	If you are a diabetic and have ever attended a nutrition class for diabetics you probably have heard of this product. We have a whole collection of the different flavors and I have posted a photo of some of the ones we use the most. This is an ideal additive to diabetic cooking, baking of foods or the mixing of drinks. It is sugar free and calorie free and extremely low in sodium.<br /><br />These mixes are ideal for use in coffee, tea drinks, Italian sodas, cocktails, pancakes, waffles, diabetic cakes, over shaved ice and muffins. You can find a lot of diabetic recipes and substitute these flavorings for ingredients that have more sugar and calories. The result is surprisingly good and it will help reduce your sugar and calorie intake while helping you add more flavor to your food.<br /><br />This flavor is good for adding to coffee to get the taste of Kahlua without the added calories, sugar or alcohol. This product adds no calories, no sugar, no carbohydrates and no cholesterol to your coffee.<br /><br />It jazzes up the flavor without adding calories or a lot of salt. It only contains 5 mg of salt. I have attached a photo of the label for your review. You can add more flavoring to suit your taste.<br /><br />Flavorings like these are nice to spice up your low calorie drinks and food and the Da Vinci Gourmet brand is the best we have found. They are internationally recognized as the highest quality flavoring made and one tablespoon = a free food exchange for a diabetic.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this to you as a great product!
618	1	When my first set of bones arrived covered in thick, hairy, green mold, I just sent them back and asked for a replacement. I thought that it might just be a one time thing. But my replacment set of bones came covered with the same type of mold. I am very disappointed! Amazon rarely disappoints me, but it has this time. I will just have to look for these at my local pet store.
619	5	Those of you who love licorice or anise flavor and who happen to be tea-drinkers, rejoice! This tea is so flavorful and aromatic. The anise/licorice flavor is intense. The tea is relatively sweet, so in my opinion, the addition of sweetener is not necessary, but you may want to add a little honey to it. This is not a wimpy tea, but full bodied and the longer you steep it, the stronger it gets.
620	4	It was touted by a friend as a sleep inducer, so I tried it and it works.  It tastes kinda mediciney, but it definitely does the job.
621	5	This is a great change from the canola oil and shortening!!  When I first got it, I pan fried some fish in it and it was really delicious. Doesn't add a lot of extra taste that you might think. Also, think it's not as stinky when frying as other oils.<br /><br /> Then I had to try it on my popcorn.  Oh, that is really wonderful.<br /><br />  Only problem I had is in delivery. The oil wasn't sealed well enough and it got warm enough during delivery to become somewhat liquid.  Some of the liquid leaked out in the box.  Just a warning if you live in a warm climate area.
622	1	Ordered 2 packages of these lollipops for my son's valentines - they arrived MELTED AND MIS-SHAPED.  The product description & photo showed them as all red - I got mainly pink.  Length of lollipop stems was also NOT AS DESCRIBED in description.  CALLED CUSTOMER SERVICE about all matters and was told that is was just too bad because NO REFUNDS OR REPLACEMENTS would be issued on food items - EVEN THOUGH THEY SOLD ME SOMETHING OTHER THAN WHAT I PURCHASED.<br /><br />FRAUDULENT COMPANY - DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!
623	3	Great product though the shipping charges were ridiculous. The product cost less than $3.00 but the shipping charges were around $11.00. I overlooked that when I made the purchase (I was in a hurry). Be more careful than I was when ordering from this vendor.
624	5	My toddler LOVES these!!!  She begs for them the moment we get into the car when I pick her up from preschool.  The only hard this is that she can't open the cap by herself (which I don't mind, or else, she's "break into them").  The cap is also resealable, which is nice in case.  I highly recommend these. I used to buy Ella's Kitchen Organic Smoothies and baby food pouches, but they are WAY more expensive!  The taste is just as great!  Buy these!
625	5	if you purchase this, your money is well spend . this product from Guyana is perfect and taste better than the 15 yr.
626	5	The Peanut Chews brought back memories of my favorite candy. The quality is the same and the taste is as I remembered. The only disapointment was that the item did not come in the original wrapper. The price was very reasonable and was delivered quickly by Amazon and in perfect condition. Thanks for the memories!
627	5	Bought a box at supermarket and loved them.  They taste great and contain plenty of fiber to boot.  Ordered thru subscribe and save so I don't have to worry about running out and waste gas driving to store.  Ordered arrived in 2 days in great shape. Thank you Amazon.
628	1	I really love these chips and have a tendency to buy in bulk.  Best for time, effort and the cost is typically better.  So, I purchased 12 bags!  Well, I open the box just recently and grabbed one bad only to realize that the seem on the back side of the bag was not sealed.  I took out another bag and realized that the 2nd bags seal was not sealed properly.  We have a quality issue that I have not addressed with the retailer or manufacturer.  I will do so this week!  So bummed!
629	5	This delicate white tea with the smoothest hint of luscious dewy pear and a kiss of vanilla takes me back to my childhood days of running around in sun all day, eating fresh fruit that would drip all the way down to my elbows washed down by massive amounts of tea.<br /><br />I have to agree with the reviewer below that the taste is faint, and that's the best part of this tea. Sometimes you want something soft and soothing but not herbal, that almost tastes like juicy water and this really takes the punch.<br /><br />I love it with a bit of sugar, and it gets even better when cooled or made with ice. For those watching calories, sugar can be omitted and this tea can be drunk in gallons to refresh and tranquilize. I can forget all about store bought iced teas and all the soda in the world when presented with this, as it is truly a tea I can see myself buying for the rest of my life. It's gentler than black tea, healthier and 100% natural with less caffeine than coffee and that flowery aroma of summer bouquets caught in a tiny tea bag is a marvel to behold.<br /><br />-Kasia S.
630	3	Great cheap soda. Worth every penny of the $.47 cents that it costs. Not worth $6.99 plus shipping.
631	5	This stuff is really good, full of flavor.  I'm eating spagetti with this marinara sauce while typing this.  As per the instructions on the box all you have to do is heat it with a teaspoon of olive oil.  I like it with some heat so I add a good amount of black pepper (maybe 1/2 teaspoon or more).  Also it's a little too watery for my liking so I boil it and let some of the liquid evaporate.  Just my personal preference.  Otherwise this is absolutely perfect.
632	5	Passed the test - Made my dad very happy. He was very pleased with the amount and quality of the pistachios.
633	1	Either for licensing or cost reasons, these arent k-cups.  Its the top of a k-cup with the filter bag full of coffee stuck to the bottom.  Therefore the coffee wont stay fresh and while you could put it in a ziploc or other storage container, the coffee is going to be exposed to air and go stale a lot faster than a k-cup.  They also dont fit well into a k-cup holder.<br /><br />I wont buy this brand again.  One of the main reasons why I like k-cups is they keep the coffee a lot fresher than regular coffee in a bag.
634	5	These taste great, they arrived 1 day early and they are super fresh and delicious. Never had the cheddar jack flavor, and they taste amazing. Perfect amount for a snack.
635	4	I don't know why we can't get excellent quality green tea powder in this country without having to pay a fortune for it.
636	4	Very good blend of seasonings for pork and chicken.  I think it will be good on fish as well but haven't tried it yet.<br />For doing ribs I would recommend accenting with a little brown sugar.<br /><br />The maple and smoke flavor comes across very nice without being too much or tasting like imitation type seasonings.<br /><br />McCormick does it again with a great product!
637	5	These are a delicious and healthy snack when eaten in moderation. The flavor is great and isn't too over powering at all. The wasabi flavor is strong and feels like it's going to be hot but the heat never really shows up.
638	5	I have been eating this cereal for a couple of years now and I really like it. It has lots of fiber and great taste. I like buying it in the 3 big boxes and have it automatically delivered by Amazon. Very convenient.
639	5	I had a dinner at my house and the guest loved the jerk chicken that I made. I will be ordering more. THANKS!
640	3	These cinnamon oatmeal squares are fine--not great, but not terrible, either. On the plus side, they stay incredibly crispy in milk--way crispier than a shredded wheat or flake cereal. And they have a pleasant enough flavor; however, the cinnamon is way too subtle for my liking. They're fine with milk for breakfast, but I wouldn't just snack on them out of the box.
641	5	These treats come in small (cat) packages and large (dog) packages.  I save money by buying the dog size for my 5 rescued cats and breaking up the larger pieces.  I have a timed treat feeder that is in use when we are away from home, and this is a big favorite with the group.  Short of fixing them some freshly cooked chicken breast (tough to do when we're not home!), this is one of the healthiest and tastiest treats around.
642	5	These bars are absolutely delicious.  I have steered clear of any of the so-called fiber bars, snack bars, etc., because honestly they all tasted like stale cereal to me.  These are completely different--no cereal similarities at all.  They are all nuts and fruit.  It's hard to stop at one!  Try them; you will not be disappointed.
643	5	I tried these chips about 4 years ago before the blue corn tortilla chips were popular. The second I finished eating one chip I knew I would be a customer for life. These are absolutely amazing. I wish all of the ingredients were organic but i won't be too picky. The 12 bags are quite a bit to get in one order but it is much cheaper than getting it at a local store. If you like to entertain these would be a good idea to keep handy for a more healthy option for your guests. I love these little guys. I would recommend to anyone.
644	4	The Switch in Kiwi Berry is a good tasting carbonated drink. It's fruity sweet with a bit of tang.<br /><br />We have made our own carbonated juice or punch drinks in the past using a home carbonating gadget. While it's not hard to do this, we can only make limited quantities and it's not very portable. But we love the results.<br /><br />The Switch took this same idea and packaged in their rather smallish cans. (Good size for kids, a bit too small for adults.) I'm still concerned with the sugar involved. At 35 grams a can, it still seems a bit much. But there is no caffeine, no added corn syrup, no added sugar, or other ingredients normally found in colas.<br /><br />But for what it is, The Switch soda is quite tasty. It's a great alternative to standard sodas out there. (Water is still best!)
645	3	These mochi candies are smaller than they look, and there is nothing in the product description. The photo doesn't really provide any frame of reference.  The price and weight (which is not obvious) are the only clues a buyer might have, that these candies are gumdrop-sized. The product itself is fine and of good quality; it simply needs a better description.
646	5	We love this soup in my home. I tend to add personalized ingredients to prepared meals, and this soup is no exception.  I always make a double batch and add chicken, diced tomatoes, rotel tomatoes with lime and cilantro, and a can of corn. My family and friends love it. Some of them have also begun to use it as a base for experimenting with their own personalized additions, as well. It has the warmth and soothing tone of comfort food. It's even good for breakfast.
647	5	I was amazed when I first tried this soup.  It was gluten free, and it was GOOD!  I was amazed.  It was also outrageously expensive at my local store, hence my online search.  Finding it here was a tremendous boon.  I can have it delivered to my doorstep for about half the cost of going to pick it up at the store.
648	5	After trying all the "bold" labeled K-Cups offered (and even making my own) I think this is the best one out there.  It's bold, balanced, non acidic, has no aftertaste and is well rounded.  Bam !
649	5	When i took this out my puppy couldn't wait to get into it.  I put the treats in and he went to town.  One of the best toys i've gotten him ever.
650	4	I do not eat them but I both my husband and father in law like them and they seem to be eaten whenever I set them on the table.  This is my 4th or 5th time buying.  I crumble them in ice cream for my husband and it has a nice texture as a contrast to the ice cream (also think it helps make the taste more robust).  I like that they are spelt and sugar free for him.<br /><br />I do have friends who think they are dry and tasteless so I cannot give it 5 star.<br /><br />Love Amazon, I would give Amazon 5 Stars!
651	1	i ordered these from wag.com not checking reviews first. wish i had.<br />i gave these to my 6 months old puppy, and he's had horrible diarrhea for a day and a half.<br />just came back home to a puppy with diarrhea AND BLEEDING. yes, bleeding. not 'some' bleeding, but significant bleeding (not a hemorrhage either).<br />my puppy is very healthy otherwise, and i haven't changed anything else on his diet, except for these new treats.<br /><br />i am typing this review from the vet's office.
652	5	A co-worker of mine loves these and can't find them anywhere, so I found them, of course, on Amazon and purchased them for him. Loved it.
653	5	as someone else already mentioned, if does get clumpy after it is opened, but it doesn't affect the taste at all.<br />this stuff is delicious !
654	5	I first got this tea as a gift from on of my good friends, I brought it to work and shared it with other coworkers.  They also loved the taste and smell of the tea.  Next thing you know I ran out of it, and ordered some more from amazon.  I got the order fast, and this time I am going to be drinking it myself.  The tea is great, but is costly.
655	5	After reading the other review for this wonderful cat food,I wondered why the previous reviwer had decided to give it less than 5 stars? She mentioned that her cat didn't care for the salmon in it, however, the concept of the food is excellent. Well, yes, I agree, although, I would have given this excellent cat food the highest rating. My cats, all 5 of them, love all the flavors of this brand. And they are very finicky too.<br />I hope they introduce even more flavors of this ultra healthy brand of feline food in the future.
656	5	The coffe is a real european blend it only takes a minute to make and it cost only half or less then the other coffe's like krups that cost twice as much. My wife and I love it.
657	5	These cookies taste odd at first, but they've really grown on me and our friends like them too. They're among the most flavorful of the low-salt items we've tried so far.
658	4	I make almost all of my baby's food, but we buy some for on-the-go and unexpected outings.  The bar is set very high on taste and quality, as my 9 month old has refused to eat some brands we have tried to feed him.  I also always taste anything I feed to my son, so again, I have high expectations.  This food was a great deal, and we like the Earth's Best brand, so I bought some.  My son loves it, and I think it tastes great.  An easy way for breakfast on-the-go, instead of having to deal with mixing rice or oatmeal cereal and his fruit.  The only warning I have is that I thought I would be getting a banana/grain & apricot/grain variety pack, but it is banana/apricot/grain all in one jar.  The wording was a little confusing & the flavor on the jar pictured was really small.  But it turned out to be a hit!
659	5	I had never purchased this before, but ordered it along with other gifts. The cat was in heaven! I had no idea it would be such a hit. Super funny!
660	5	The bars are great!  They taste great and are healthy!  They're very filling.
661	4	Well the product was good and the taste is great. The convenience was excellent and the delivery was quick. So what's not to love? The darn things tend to clog up my machine. Never ever happens with coffee. May one could run hot water after each serving to prevent the clog. Otherwise an excellent product.
662	1	I can't believe I didn't check out the ingredients for this.  I never would have bought it if I would have known there was artificial sweetener in it!  First cup though, I got that weird after taste it gives and that was all she wrote.  If you don't have a problem with a chemical taste or concerns about health problems, you may like it.  Not worth it to us.
663	3	The jar is much smaller than I imagined via pictures - I thought it was going to be the size of a mason jar, but it was instead much smaller. It is spicy though! Lots of jalapeno, not a lot of honey mustard!
664	5	I've tried smokehouse, jalapeno smokehouse, honey roast, lime and chili, and natural. But these are really the best of the lot I've tried. They have the nice fresh-tasting almonds you expect from Blue Diamond, and you can actually taste the wasabi (unlike the jalapeno smokehouse, where the jalapeno part is really elusive).<br /><br />I was reluctant at first to try this. Didn't think I'd like it. I was wrong. Terrific snack almonds (if you don't mind saltiness). Love em.<br /><br />Mir
665	5	I heard about this product, but I couldn't find it anywhere in my local store. I was glad to find it at the Amazon. It came quickly. It is so fine, I don't know wether I need to rinse it or not. Anyway, I rinsed it once, it is hard to get rid of rinsing water without loosing the grains. I cooked the Teff with millet or quinoa. It turned out very tasty with added flavor and a little gelatin texture. My kids doesn't like quinoa by itself, it has a special flavor they don't like, with teff, it covered the quinoa taste and made it taste better. If you cook millet by itself, it is too dry, with teff, it adds some gelatin texture to it. I also grind it to flour, and add it to baking. It was great. I already used up one bag.
666	4	I've been keeping a case of these in the house for a long time now and it's a good addition when you don't want to cook a big dinner or just don't want to eat much for lunch or something. It's different than regular ramen noodles since those are extremely instant; this kind you have to let it cook for a little longer to make sure it's getting softer and wider and edible. It's not that spicy if you take it easy with the spice packets. I always receive it quite fast after I place the order so I like that too.
667	5	Got this for our retriever / doberman mix...she loved it!  At first it was so large that I think she was a bit intimidated by it, but after a few days of coming up with an attack strategy she went right to town.<br /><br />...and finished it in 3 days.<br /><br />Typically a large rawhide lasts about 4-5 hours for her, so it was definitely a value.  Also, it was hilarious to watch her run around the house holding onto it.<br /><br />Bought it for one of our friends pitbulls too, it's a great dog gift!
668	5	I have been looking for a good substitute for a morning McDonalds Mocha (which I had officially become addicted to). I brew this in my travel mug coffee maker, add some milk, french vanilla liquid creamer, equal, a bit of chocolate syrup, and reddi whip and I'm good to go.  Addiction/money wasting done for!!
669	4	I like this coffee with a few cookies or a little cake. It is sweet and makes a medium strength small cup perfectly in my opinion. I would by it again or give it to a friend.
670	5	There were a few complaints about excessive water content in this salt.  I dry my salt using a clay bar pan in my oven using just the light.  We have high humidity here in central Illinois.  After a day or two in the oven with periodic stirring it is dry enough to put in my grinder and I store the rest in a canister with a loose lid.  Curious about how much weight was water I weighed the salt before and after drying one time and did not see a signifcant difference.  My scale is not the most accurate but close enough to tell the water weight isn't that much of a consideration.  What with the price difference between the already dried and finely ground salt I'll stick with this one.  We have been using this salt for probably eight years and love it. Our chiropractor recommended it and we have never gone back.  The taste difference is really distinct.
671	4	I enjoy Starbucks coffee and this K-cup is no exception but like Starbucks coffee shops, the price is a little extravagant for what you get. Then again, I find that the nature of using k-cups is a guilty pleasure.
672	4	I opened the package (with some trepidation based on other reviews), rinsed off the fishy smelling liquid and dropped the noodles into some simmering tomato sauce.  After waiting about 8 minutes, I plated and pigged out!  The texture was odd but not unpleasant and the noodles had absorbed the sauce flavor.  I felt satisfied and full.  That's all I can ask!
673	1	Tuna soup  -- who woulda thought???  Not chunk light tuna, rather brown mush.  You can't rinse it because it all goes down the drain as a liquid mess, and if you are lucky enough to squeeze the water out, you wind up with less than half a can of mush.  Even my cats won't eat it.  You're better off paying a little more for solid white cause you not only get a full can, but cost-wise it's a better deal.
674	5	I bought these to share with the office and the disappeared almost instantly.  They are very good and contain enough protein to keep people going while suppressing that "snacky" feeling.  These are a great snack to carry with you as they are very light (for example, on a flight or road trip).  I highly recommend that you try a few of the other flavors as well.  They have this snack in Chicken, Turkey and Beef in various flavors.
675	4	Chilies were a little smaller than I had expected but after using a few of them the smaller size,about 4", has proved to be fine. I can eat two without feeling guilty. The flavor is a little mild so need to be stuffed with a strong cheese.
676	5	This bark is one of the best we've ever tasted and it was so nice to be able to purchase it in the warm weather and not just at Christmas time.
677	5	This is my favorite among all the dressings........But it is hard to find in the stores. The shelves are loaded with GS Italian Dressing. It is rare when I can find my favorite. The only place I found it was Walmart....and they don't keep enough in stock. I found it availible on Amazon. So, I ordered a whole box of it along with a box of the Garlic and Cheese. I would like to know why the stores don't carry a varity. Even COSTCO & BJ's only carry the Italian. That is NOT my favorite.<br /><br />JTD
678	2	I bought this olive oil since it was organic, and went through 6 (750 mL) cans on a subscription, but in the end I decided to stop buying it. I bought this oil to be my basic mid-priced olive oil primarily for sauteing. I like all sorts of olive oil -- from soft and buttery to peppery and green. This oil has a heavy woody scent, not as fragrant as other good EVOO in this price range. Sampled uncooked, the oil has mild initial taste, not much olive flavor at all, but not unpleasant, but what I didn't like is its harsh after-taste. It was not good in salad dressings. With other flavorings, the harshness is muted but still remains. In cooked dishes any olive oil flavor mostly disappears. In the same price range, I've had better luck with obscure Spanish or Greek 1 L cans of EVOO from the supermarket.
679	1	Love good tasting Root Beer. This is too Sweet. Tried to get the grand kids to drink it and even they say its to sweet papa. 46g of sugar.
680	5	My nine year old son is allergic to wheat, corn, rice and soy. And he loves this crust! Thank goodness!
681	5	I think providing variety to young taste buds is important<br /><br />Organic is the way to go !! and Earths best is the brand we trust.
682	5	I was skeptical of these because I do not have a taste for healthier food...but I am trying!  I didn't have to put any effort into liking these, they are wonderful!  I have no issues giving up regular chips up for these.  Everyone I have let try them like them...including my toddler!
683	1	These were a disappointment.  I've had this brand before and they were quite good.  This batch tasted stale, perhaps it had been on the shelf too long.  In addition, almost all of individually wrapped biscotti arrived broken.  It must have had a rough ride.  I won't order these again.  If it wouldn't have been a hassle, I would have sent them back for my money back.
684	5	Wild Ride Beef Jerkey is incredibly tender and flavorful.  Most jerky products I've tried in the past are like flavored shoe leather - WFBJ is definitely heads and shoulders above all the others.  There's actually some substance to it - and the fact that it's low fat with NO preservatives is a big selling point for me!  If you like spicey - try the Black Pepper one ------
685	5	My whole family loves this pasta that is hollow and slightly bigger around than regular spaghetti noodles. I cannot find it anywhere locally, so will continue getting it from Amazon.
686	5	So much better than the bright artificial green mint jellies; this is the perfect compliment for a nice leg of lamb, carved off the bone into juicy slices, pink and delicious. Somehow mint totally brings out the flavor.
687	5	We love the product, excellent taste. However the shipping and handling cost the same as the product $ 32.00. Is there a less costly way of shipping? We will be ordering again.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />S.Wolfson<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000S4GCNM">Pomi Marinara Sauce, 26.46 Ounce Tetra Pack (Pack of 12)</a>
688	5	If you love MINT with DARK CHOCOLATE, then you must try these!  High quality ingredient makes them DELICIOUS!!!  This was a perfect stocking stuffer, but I think it's worth having every day!
689	5	I got hooked on Lyons Gold in Ireland.<br />Great tea - full-bodied, three bags makes<br />a large pot and loses none of the flavor!
690	4	I used these for the candy buffet I had at my wedding and I must say these were literally bursting with orange flavor. I usually find gum balls to be pretty bland no matter the flavor. These were very hard to me and hurt my teeth a little bit, so it lost a star, but I would recommend them based on the flavor alone. They looked great for the autumn themed candy buffet we had going on.
691	3	These bars have a pasty consistancy and are greasy with a slightly off-taste (in my opinion).  They are very sweet and are, indeed, filling so they are great in the car when trying to avoid fast-food but I only like them enough to use them as a last resort.  Great ingredients though and probably very good for the body.
692	1	The picture is really deceiving. The lollipops are so small compared to the picture. Do not buy this if you are expecting them to look like the ones in the picture.
693	5	My 12 yr old cat has soft tissue problems with her hips and upper rear legs and Hip Action has made a world of difference with her mobility.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product.
694	5	My wife and I eat really spicy food. We love the chips since it's pretty spicy. It is a lot spicier than the spicy salsa so I wouldn't reccommend to people who can't eat anything that's spicier than that. I wish there's beef jerky that's this spicy.
695	4	Our dog has a sensitive stomach. So, we are relatively picky about the food we give him. We have had more than one day of scrubbing out vomit from the carpet all over the house. So, we decided to try this new style of dog food, and see how our dog Jake would respond to it. Truth is, he loves it...and it agrees with him. It is a great dog food!<br /><br />Furthermore, this dog food has a zipper on the top of the bag. This helps keep the food fresh, and makes it much easier to handle.<br /><br />The problem we have with this food is simply the price, which is over 2x what we pay for the other dog food that agrees with our puppies sensitive tummy.<br /><br />So, if you can afford this, get it. If not, find something more comparable in your price range.
696	4	I've never used pest repellent before however live at the edge of a forest treeline so we constantly have skunks, deer, racoons and other critters coming out of the woods. I like the deer but don't like the skunks, for some reason something startles them around my AC unit and when that happens the house just starts to stink. We also have some bushes in our front yard that neighborhood cats seems to like to use as a bathroom. Typically daily I'd go out and see an animal, yesterday I put this out around the house and I hadn't seen the guys roaming around which is unusual.<br /><br />Also, I appreciate the design of this container. It has an adjustable cap on it that doubles as a dispenser so you can sprinkle a little bit or a lot depending on your application.<br /><br />The repellent itself has a peppery smell, it's a bit overwhelming at first but after it's been on the ground for 15-30 minutes the scent dies down.<br /><br />So far so good. I would recommend this if you have a critter problem.
697	5	My Akita has to be switched from food to food constantly. He gets bored fat. The trick is to get high quality dry and canned food that doesn't make him sick. He's not sensitive perse...there have been only a few dog foods that affected him adversely. This food is not one of them. He wolfs it right down every time we feed it to him. I'm buying more as I type.
698	3	I am a S'more addict, so when I saw this cereal, I HAD to get it. And I was excited to say the least.<br /><br />Until I tasted it.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong--it's definitely tasty...but it's just not what I wanted it to be. The "graham" pieces are air-puffed pieces that don't really taste much like graham crackers--this cereal would have been MUCH better off with graham pieces &agrave; la Golden Grahams (except that's another company so I am sure there was some reason they couldn't). The marshmallow ratio was nice--always my favorite part of a breakfast cereal! And it was okay in milk--but I'll probably just eat it dry from now on.<br /><br />So, overall, it tasted vaguely of S'mores...but had I been blindfolded, I probably wouldn't have been able to guess what it was. I would still eat it, of course. :) And I do plan to enjoy the rest of my four boxes.
699	4	I just tried the nutty marshmallow and it is awesome.<br />I have problems with some bars due to acid reflux and also gallbladder problems, but this hasn't bothered me yet. Plus at 150 calories it is a pretty lightweight snack, though a little small. Vegan too for those who want vegan treats. It's not made from real marshmallow root (which I was hoping for), but then almost no marshmallow snacks are.
700	5	Cooked up excellently in a crockpot - just be sure to have enough water and if you want a more toothsome end product, don't stir. The grains are tiny, like chia seeds, but they are firm and held up well with prolonged cooking (i.e. 2+hours on high in crockpot). On the stove top, it might be more difficult to monitor. Texture wise the grains were firm albeit quite tiny, (again in size think chia) and as for the flavor- not as robust as quinoa IMHO but I have to admit I'm not a devotee of quinoa since I don't like the saponin residue that seems to linger on the grains (probably me not washing it enough though). Kaniwa is easier to prepare since it does not require any rinse - throw it in a bowl/pot and you're good to go. I love this and the fact that it offers people another healthy gluten free option. However, I wouldn't eat this as a breakfast cereal. While not distinctive in flavor like buckwheat or kashi, I think I would prefer it as a lunch/dinner option, a complement like wild rice to an entree or perhaps stuffed/mixed in with another main course dish.<br />In short, whether you like quinoa and/or other ancient grains, do give this a try. The taste is nutty, earthy (not grassy) and yes, delicious even plain. Plus, it's a nutritional powerhouse esp. good for vegetarians if the healthfood labels are accurate: 7 grams of protein for a 160 calorie (1/4cup) serving, iron 60%! You really can't go wrong! :)<br /><br />PS When opening the package, be very careful!! You do NOT want to spill this. It took me forever to suction up all the tiny seeds that escaped from a small hole I'd inadvertently made when opening the package.
701	5	Without a doubt, the name says it all: Bali's Best Coffee Candy.  Robust sweet coffee flavor, individually wrapped.
702	5	I'm not a big granola eater, but this stuff was great! Lots of flavors and textures and supposedly good for me as well. Yum!
703	3	Sugar free but it sticks to itself in the bag and to your teeth while eating.<br />Not that big of a deal if you drink some thing while munching,<br />but annoying none the less. Satisfying popcorn fix for those with this<br />dietary restriction.
704	1	There you think the name Rachael Ray would be associated with a high quality product.... it isn't. Perhaps Rachael doesn't know what a high quality ingredient is.<br /><br />Nutrish is full of fillers and allergens, though it says No Fillers on the packaging. Brown Rice is #8 on the ingredient list, which means there's hardly any brown rice in it. One of the main ingredient is Brewers Rice. Corn and soy are allergens + dogs cannot digest corn.<br /><br />***Brewers rice is the small milled fragments of rice kernels that have been separated from the larger kernels of milled rice. (AAFCO definition).[1] Brewers rice is a processed rice product that is missing many of the nutrients contained in whole ground rice and***<br /><br />I received samples of this food sent to me by the manufacturer. The samples were past the expiration date and the ingredients of the product are not good enough for my dogs. I'm sticking with Innova.
705	3	I recently purchased this product (not here but at walmart where it is $6 a box not $10) for a cake I was making for a friend.  I usually do cakes in butter cream and fondant but she wanted whipped icing.  Anyway,  I did a test batch a week before and it was really good.  The icing came out fluffy and stiff enough for icing and piping. It held up really well in the fridge for several days.  However the day of the cake it was a very hot day and not having air conditioning, my kitchen was very warm.  The icing completely collapsed despite several tries with several batches, freezing the bowl and mixer whisk, ice applied to the bowl, and extended whipping,  I could not get it to stiffen.  It was a soft, runny mess and did not make for nice icing.  I was unable to pipe with it at all. So if you purchase this just keep that in mind.  I still prefer buttercream but the taste is creamy and less sweet that buttercream if that is what you prefer.
706	5	No hydrogenated oils, no transfat - and tastes BETTER than regular peanut butter.  Stays smooth, the oil does not separate either.  I agree with other posters who said the taste reminds me of cookie dough.  Yum!
707	5	I add Flaxseed to many dishes, however I use Flaxseed almost every morning as part of my cereal which includes nut and seeds and coconut.  I get all breakfast fixins from Amazon.
708	5	I love all of the Happy Baby products, but this one is my favorite. Some highlights:<br /><br />- It is packed full of nutrition (and it is organic)<br /><br />- It is very convenient. When my daughter was younger we would mix these with cereal for breakfast. Now it is a great on-the-go snack and she eats directly from the pouch. (She is 16 months old).<br /><br />- My daughter loves it! She always asks for more.<br /><br />- With the subscribe-and-save pricing on Amazon, it's a good deal.
709	3	girlfriend hated them but i didnt mind them too much, a little more bitter than i imagined, with a earthy taste but worth the benefits i guess. tried to put them in the fridge, that made them too hard, left them in the car one day and they tasted a little better warm, kinda gooey. def a conversation peice when toting them around with you it seems eveyone asks about them. a couple of them tasted moldy, but very minor, iguess that comes with them being sun dried with no preseratives
710	5	This is a good peppermint tea.  The peppermint does not overwhelm the taste of the tea.  It is a black tea with peppermint, not an herbal tea.  There is no spearmint added as some "peppermint" teas are flavored with.  I drink this tea all day long.  Since another tea company stopped making their peppermint flavored black tea years ago, I have been searching for another peppermint tea and I have been disappointed with every one I tried until this one.
711	5	Very true to the essence of lavender if you are a fan of aromatherapy. Mixes very well with vanilla incense also.
712	4	For years, we relied on Near East Rice Pilaf to brighten weekday dinners. The product cooks quickly and the pine nuts (not lentils, as another reviewer erroneously reported) are absolutely stupendous.<br /><br />Unfortunately, inflation has hit some of the higher-end grocery items, like this one, and at these levels (including the shipping), even a carton of 12 Near East Rice Pilaf boxes is way beyond our budget. Each box feeds about five people. For two, there will be leftovers. But still. Reheated rice and pine nuts, despite the interesting spice content, aren't as good.<br /><br />We've therefore shifted to a neat Trader Joe's combination of basmati and wild rices, with vegetable bits (not offered here) that spices up daily meals with a lot less strain on the purse. Amazon does offer a 12-pack carton of tasty-sounding 6.5 ounce <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JIJH2A">Basmati Rice</a> with roasted garlic and herbs but we haven't tried it, as even that is a bit too steep for us.<br /><br />We'll finish all the Near East products now on our shelves. But delicious or not, the stuff has just grown too dear.
713	5	I have been hosting backyard movies every summer for the past 5 years and I love using this popcorn at the concession stand. It has the real movie theater taste and it makes plenty for our guests. great product and company!
714	4	I've always been a fan of Eight O'Clock, and will search for it while shopping at grocery stores. Having the ability to ship to my overseas address is a delight. The darker roasts are personal favorites, and I've never been disapointed in the coffee when it arrives at my door.
715	5	Do you miss having your favorite pies? This flour mix makes a fantastic gluten free pie crust. I find Pamela's mixes to be excellent. I especially love the Pancake mix.
716	4	My dogs favorite dry food is the cats leftover science diet, if she can get it, so I'm not too sure about her street creds when it comes to choosing dog food, however she likes the Purina Beneful original dog food  for the time being. Any dry food she doesn't turn her nose up at is a plus.<br /><br />The bag shows chunks of real beef and veggies as well as a picture of the actual food. I don't think a reasonable person would expect to pour out actual beef chunks any more then they would expect to pour a fully frosted cake , like the one on the front of the box, from a box of cake mix. The product page and the back of the bag give the ingredients.  I sort of question the addition of sugar and I suppose the color is for the benefit of the owner but ,from what I've read, the chicken byproducts ( feet, neck etc) are good for the dog. No animal "waste" can be used. The word "meal" means the byproduct is received in a dry state instead of a wet state.<br /><br />I think the bottom line is do you trust the reputation and integrity of the manufacturer? It's probably not gourmet food but do you trust them to put out a healthy product? Do you believe they get their ingredients from a reputable company and run all the required salmonella and bacterial tests? Since I'm no expert on dog food that's what I have to do.
717	3	This was not the big exciting chew fest I thought my dogs would like.  Both (Sheltie mix and long-haired chihuahua) were nonchalant about it, preferring to drop it in the hopes of getting something better.  For my picky boys, it wasn't a good purchase so I won't be getting them again.
718	5	this pineapple product is wonderful. However, I wish they had smaller cartons, 12 bags is way too much. This seller also has mixed dried fruits in a carton of 6 bags.  That would be perfect for the pineapple chunks.<br /><br />Something to think about for Emerald Harmony products.
719	1	Unfortunately, I remembered the name but couldnot figure out what was wrong, so I ordered the minimum, two expensive large bottles.  I tried the sodium deficient, bitter soy product at every meal with various dishes and on solo vegetables.  Today, I trashed one expensive open bottle because scummy is the after taste.  Don't buy this product.<br /><br />I normally love Commercial Soy Sauce.
720	5	These cookies were soft, great tasting and affordable! A definite must try, even the kids will love them! Oatmeal raisin an all time fave
721	5	When my daughter was born she was on similac since I was not able to fully breast feed her, so in the following weeks we used it and it was fine until she developed baby acne and spit it up a lot, then we heard about Earth's Best. We decided to try it out and it's been a great decision ever since. She no longer spits it up (as much..) and no baby acne. We are definitely recommend this product. The shipping has been impeccable every time I order it. There are no complaints here...
722	3	I love this cheese.  However, it is far to expensive.  I found I can have my local store get Mizithra Cheese for me at about a quarter of the cost of ordering it here.
723	5	I grew up eatting saladitos but since I have moved to Florida they are hard to come by.  Every now and then I crave something salty and this does it.
724	5	I put these in my kids' school lunches as a treat.  Being organic I can feel good about letting them have this treat and they love it when they open their lunch box and see one of these in there, as they are delicious.
725	5	My kitten is 8 months old and we've seen such a change in his coat since switching to this brand of food. Previously we fed him the Fancy Feast kitten food and he liked it but after reading horror stories about the ingredients in most commercial cat foods we decided to switch to something more natural. He loves this one too and as previsouly mentioned, we've seen such a change in his fur - softer and much shinier.
726	5	I love this cereal. It's very tasty, and has a great texture. I've ordered it from Amazon for several years and it always arrives fresh. It's also surprisingly healthy and, for gluten intolerent folks, it contains no wheat!
727	5	This is great wholesome snack while in the office.  I throw it in my cup, add some hot water, let it sit for a while, and then add dried natural goat milk which makes it fantastic tasting.  The oats are great by themselves but some type of protein is needed to eat with them or it's like eating too much starch.  For the price it's a good deal.
728	5	I have always wanted to like greent tea but never been able to.  My sister gave me a cup of this tea at her house and i was completely won over.  It's taste is so smooth with the mild sweetness of jasmine.  My husband and i have successfully quit coffee thanks to this tea.
729	5	I heard about Eight O' Clock's Colombian ground coffee on a Consumer Reports radio segment, and I knew I had to try this. I'm the guy who buys the coffee for our office and I'm always on the lookout for something new for the staff to try, and this one was a BIG hit. Flavorful with a smooth richness one would expect from a more expensive brand but, without the price tag, and the burnt aftertaste of some of the other coffees to include Starbucks, this is one that made the office shortlist in well short order!
730	4	The dog food comes in a nice and study zip lock bag that works very nicely in our high traffic home where our grandson loves to play in the dog food. The dogs really enjoy the selection and have no trouble emptying the bowl. A nice texture nothing to cleanup.
731	4	This stuff is not half bad. I use it to make a yummy healthier sundae. First I heat up a Deep Chocolate Vitatop and then I heat up 2tbs. of the choc.syrup. I put a light ice cream(such as Skinny cow single serve Chocolate Fudge brownie or Dulce de Leche)on top of the vitatop, pour the hot Walden Farms syrup on top and then put a couple dollops of the Walden Farms marshmallow dip on top. Yummy! Very fun and filling--for only about 250 calories. A very sensible treat.
732	5	If you want a good pinto bean you can not go wrong here.  Made some great tasting chili and organic too!
733	5	I love Pamelas Baking Mix.  We use it all the time for my son with Celiac Disease.  He loves the pancakes but also muffins and banana bread.  We also use it for chocolate chip cookies and really yummy cornbread  Pamela's web site has some great recipes for the mix and some helpful baking hints.  You can substitute it for flour in your regular recipes - just account for the baking powder and other ingredients that are already in the mix.
734	5	Having multuple dogs to feed snacks to I can tell you this is their number one choice, hands down. Helping with hip relief is an added perk. This item should get a TEN star rating.
735	5	For my dog, this natural dog food was a good choice to gradually move off his usual food to see how he would react to it. He has some food allergies that I wanted to see if changing his diet might clear it up. This Duck formula worked for him. He loves it and has had no problems with elimination or lack of appetite. He is a 2+ year old rescued Border Collie with a little bit of food allergies and a weight problem. Happy to say he is now gaining some weight, enjoying this dog food, and getting some much needed love and exercise while showing improvement with the food allergies. I would recommend this for almost any dog as a safe change of diet if you do it a little at a time. I started with the 6 pound bag mixing it with his old food and then when everything looked good, ordered the 25 pound bag. It is expensive but I believe my dog is worth it.
736	3	Good packaging.  Have the sunflower, sesame, flaxseed and wheat gern from Bob's Red Mill, all of which are very good.  However, the date pieces would be tastier if they were slightly bigger.  They are very small and rolled in flour and this cuts down on their flavor.  I bought them primarily to use as a snack.  Have seen similar date pieces in homes that look like very tiny short sausages.  Unfortunately I don't know the brand.
737	5	My 2 little dogs are a bit fussy and I like to feed them a quality dog food.  Merrick Whole Earth makes all of us very happy.  My girls love it and it's better for them compared to brands with lots of cereal filler and fat.
738	5	Kahlua has been and continues to be one of my very favorite coffee flavors! It is not too strong nor is it too mild - just a wonderful flavor to get my mornings started!
739	5	My husband worked for this Oreintal family who gave him a 48 oz package of  NOH Hawaiian Iced Tea . He raved on how good it was . I didnt believe him until I actually tried it . UMMMM great cool taste and refreshing Ice tea . I would definetely recommend
740	5	I'm already a Green Mountain coffee fan but the French Vanilla is a great way to start the morning!<br />The price was fantastic and the delivery was immediate.  Thank You!
741	5	This is a fantastic tea.  The company always ships very quickly and the orders are accurate.  I now have several of these tins though, and I wish they'd offer just the bag refill for the tin.
742	4	This coffee smells a bit like Starbuck's Breakfast Blend, but it doesn't taste anywhere near as strong which, in my opinion, is preferred.  There isn't, however, any guidance whatsover on the box regarding preparation.  Thus, when I made my first mug of Marley Coffee, I wasn't sure how much water I was supposed to use or how much time I was supposed to wait, so I chucked in two packets and let them steep for two minutes.  The result tasted fine; not the best I'd ever had, but good enough for a sample run.  My second go with the coffee was a bit more involved, but met with better brewing results.  My household had run out of ground coffee, so I cut open several Marley packets to use in our <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002S4DI2S">Technivorm Moccamaster Coffee Brewer With Thermo Carafe - Technivorm 9587</a>.  I measured out coffee as I usually would with a scoop and brewed it up.  My wife and I both enjoyed the result.  I would get this product again.
743	5	I'm addicted to salty and tangy flavors, so when I opened my first bag of Sea Salt & Vinegar Kettle Brand chips I knew I had a perfect complement to my vegetable trays of cucumber, carrot, celery and cherry tomatoes. Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.<br /><br />As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />I also recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, "...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly."
744	5	I like the taste of this salt.  Heard of health benefits of the Himalayan salt and thought I'd try it.  I will reorder this again.
745	2	Having been used to the moisture and texture of Primal Spirit and Tofurky Jurky, I have to say I was utterly disappointed by these.  They're far too dry and require much more jaw-work than should be required to enjoy some jerky.<br /><br />Plus, with only 12 packets, it seems you get less product for the price than you do with the other vegan jerkies available on Amazon.  With so much better stuff out there, I wouldn't waste my money on this product again, even to try a different flavor.
746	5	I drink it everyday and it tastes great! Each box came packed in clear plastic and I feel secure buying it again. Good deal for the money.
747	5	I've tried all the Alo brand flavors and this one, in my personal opinion, is by FAR the best. It has a perfect taste of Mango and Mangosteen (which I had never heard of before), but it is quite personally addicting (just the right amount of sweetness. The pulp in the drink is also very soft and goes down smooth. You could literally open the cap and down the whole bottle in 2 or 3 gulps, it's that good!<br /><br />Not sure what the cost is on here since the item is currently out of stock, but out here in Hawaii where I live you can usually find this for about $1.59 a bottle. I wouldn't pay more than that unless you have no other options.<br /><br />5 stars for being so addicting!
748	4	this tastes like home made beef jerky to me. there is also a ton of it in one bag. for 20.00 i thought it might be a little pricey but its a good deal compared to store brands and a lot better. i did not find the meat to soy saucey or tough like some others mentioned. i went ahead and bought another bag.
749	5	I adore this coconut oil.  It smells incredible, tastes delicious, and adds a lovely sheen to your skin.  I put this on my face before washing it to clean off makeup and regularly use this as a body lotion after showering and to remove eye makeup.  It makes your skin wonderfully soft and yummy-smelling and doesn't have any difficult to pronounce ingredients like regular body lotions do.<br />Also, I use this as a topping for air-popped popcorn (since it's oil, it doesn't have water and doesn't make popcorn soggy - butter does this), and I put it on bread in place of butter since it melts faster and is tasty, and I use it in the pan to cook stir-fry, eggs, and anything else I want to cook!  All in all, this stuff is awesome!  I just wish it came in a better container, but as soon as I run out I'll buy another jug of Nutiva coconut oil (this is my second one).
750	4	This product is delivered in dry ice (nicely packaged).  The nan breads are easy to heat in a<br />toaster oven and tastes great.
751	5	My Lab puppy 10 weeks loves this toy and the small is plenty big enough for her as well as my full grown Westie. They seem to love the shape and the rope. The food does not seem to be the main part of the appeal.
752	5	I absolutly love this product. After use it makes my skin feel so soft and refreshed. After the first use, I could tell a difference in my skin. Its deffently worth getting in my book.
753	4	A good choice for a yerba mate drinker. A little bitter but still a good one to try.
754	5	This tea, teabag or loose tea, tastes the way tea should.<br />I have used both for several years. End of review.
755	5	My granddaughter says that the applecinnamon is "yummy-licious." The GoGo SquueZ containers make no mess. This is a good bargain and perfect as an on-the-go snack.
756	2	It seems the flavor selection on Amazon has been limited these days to some variation of hazelnut, french vanilla or chocolate so when I saw this one, I thought I'd give it a try.  Never having had Wolfgang Puck's k-cups, I was hoping they'd be as good as the Wolfgang Puck coffee I've had in hotel coffeemakers that were a part of my room but alas, I was mistaken. I wouldn't say it's the worst I've had but the flavor is pretty weak and the coffee itself is too.  I feel like I'm drinking coffee that's been made with grounds that have already been perked.  In other words - the flavor seems to be already squeezed out of them and I'm getting leftovers.<br /><br />If you're looking for a weakly flavored coffee that doesn't really taste like much of anything, this is your pod.  If you're looking for better, richer flavors, stick with Green Mountain which sadly Amazon doesn't seem to carry anymore except through third party vendors who want to charge $60 for a box!
757	5	This candies themselves are extremely sour and tricking people into eating them is fun. Plus it is very colorful and decorative.
758	5	Excellent pretzel!  Can't find locally so I order in bulk - and they don't last long.  My daughter even asked for a box (12 bags) for her birthday.  Go figure!
759	5	My dog Ellie is allergic to chicken so I have to be very careful what she eats.  These are perfect for her.  I give her the venison and the beef.  They are soft so they do not upset her digestive system.  Most importantly she loves them so they make a great training treat.
760	2	I'm surprised at all of the 5 star reviews. I did not like this coffee at all - and I like both raspberry and chocolate. I couldn't find anyone in my family that liked it, and then I brought it in to my office to give to my coworkers, and not one of them liked it either ... so I still have half a box left that I can't even give away.<br /><br />With that said, as of this writing, there are 8 people that thought highly enough of this coffee to give it 5 stars, so maybe it is just an acquired taste that I don't have, but I would be careful before purchasing too large of a box of these.
761	4	Everyone in the family (and my daughter's friends) like these.  Even though you get 12 bags they don't last long.  Need to refill every few months.
762	5	This is great stuff.  Very good for small or large batches.  Nice to have the ability to make just a couple of jars of jam or jelly.  Sometimes fruit is in limited supply and expensive.  This allows me to make a variety of jams and jellies in small batches to enjoy all year long.
763	5	This toy is great! I am able to latch it on to the car seat or stroller and my son just loves to play with it. All the things to grab hold to and different colors and textures make for a great time!
764	5	This is a great drink mix.  The strawberry Kiwi has the fewest net carbs (1) so for those on a very low carb diet this works great and with the added fiber it helps to keep you regular.  Some people have had trouble finding this product.  I got it at Walmart in the diet section near the cosmetics.  It was reasonably priced, but I can't remember how much, but cheaper than listed here.
765	5	After eating just half of one, I know that I will be buying another box. This is nothing even close to the fruit+nut bars sold in grocery stores. Far fresher and tastes way better.
766	5	Was told by a friend to try Nettle tea for allergies. Brought it & it works great & quickly. Long time allergy suffer who loves Nettle tea. I'm able to use it & stopped all the other medications....
767	2	First, these bags are 1.5 servings, so adjust the calories accordingly. They tasted a bit greasy and the flavor was bearable.
768	5	These K cups are wonderful! We were pleasantly surprised with the low acidity and smooth flavor! The Rodeo Drive K cups are on our top five K Cup list!
769	5	I have celiac disease, therefore gluten-free is my life.  In my opinion, Tinkyada produces the best gluten-free pasta...best texture, best taste.  Further, the vendor had the products on my doorstep in a timely manner.  I'm a happy woman.
770	2	I'm a notorious cereal addict, so I'll surely try anything once, especially if it's part of the Crunchy Nut line. I'm in love with the Honey Nut flakes version they came out with first recently in the U.S. It's perfect. Then I tasted this crap. It tastes nothing like the honey nut (which I guess is the point), but it's not in a good way. I can't even really describe it to you, it's just not an appealing taste. It's like you're eating burnt toast mixed with molasses or something. It's a shame because I love almost all things caramel too. Avoid this one.
771	3	When I ordered this item it's exactly what I would expect it to be a natural herbal laxative. It does list the importance of shouldn't be taken if pregnant as it's also a very powerful laxative and may not be suitable for some other individuals with possible digestive issues too. I know this practicing herbal medicine for over 20yrs it's warnings are valid but it should be more classified as a colon aid then a diet aid. Better yet labeled truly as it is a laxative
772	1	I purchased these Pepperidge Farm cookies for a family member that is sick in the hospital. The cookies had an expiration date of 5/2/2012 but they were STALE. This was very embarrassing and disappointing to say the least. This tells me that food products are not a good buy from Amazon.
773	4	Both my 1.5 and 3.5 year olds love these snacks.  They are a bit on the sweet side but no more so than most packaged kid snacks, and the ingredients in this item are pretty straightforward (i.e. not a lot of weird chemicals or fillers), so that makes me feel a bit better.  I also don't give them out all the time.  I tend to use them when I need a snack when we're going out and about.  This also makes sense because they aren't cheap, so to use them all the time at home would be a waste of packaging plastic and money.  I actually discovered these when one child was having a meltdown at Target and I needed something FAST to quell the outbreak and this is what was handy.  After that discovery, I found Amazon to have the best deal in bulk.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/6/2012 - Kids still love these snacks.  I alternate them with other stuff, but especially good size for younger kido.  Not too big.
774	5	Recently purchased these using the kindle with special offers grocery coupon. We have been eating them ever since. They are the best tasting gummy bears out there. My son loves them, my wife loves them, and I love them. Highly recommend if you are going to buy candy.
775	5	I bought this one until I saw one exactly like it at a big box store (think red bullseye) for 24.99. This is going back!
776	4	I won one of these in a raffle at my school.<br />It's a lot of chocolate. The reason I did take off one star is because in order for it to not melt you need to freeze it and its rather insane to break apart when its frozen. Impossible to bite into, very hard to cut with a steak knife and pizza cutter, I haven't tried a hammer yet but I have tried other heavy things. It just wont break.
777	5	I love jalapenos on everything, but the first time I found this little jewel in the grocery, I knew I had to try them.  LOVE!  I mean this has to be my newest addiction.  If Amazon will carry, I will sign up for auto ship!  Please, please carry this wonderful treat.  Not too salty, not too heavy, just right!  The perfect little addition to salads, green beans, or really any entree.  Seriously that good!
778	5	I recently purchased a bottle of this oil to make candy apples. Excellent quality , very strong, little goes a long way
779	5	I'll be the first to admit I'm no tea connoisseur. I'm a college student who likes drinking 3-4 cups of tea a tea, usually green tea. I'm used to buying in tea bags but over the last 6 months I've been buying from Teavana and Kungaloosh, which in the end got a bit expensive. So I decided to give this tea a try based on the positive reviews here.<br /><br />First off, let me point out that this is a LOT of tea for the price. I couldn't even believe it when the package arrived. It doesn't fit into one of my Teavana airtight containers, I had to put the rest in a small tupperware container. So you get incredible value. On top of that, you get TWO infusions, and the great flavor is still there on the second infusion.<br /><br />Next, let me address the quality: It's definitely got a smokey taste. You're gonna see particles floating around. It's not the cleanest tea in the world. But, it's green tea! Every green tea I've tasted has tasted similar to this. It's got a strong taste, a bit bitter, but a clean aftertaste unlike some tea bags. So I'll definitely come back and get another bag, you know, whenever this huge order runs out. Probably in 3 or 4 months.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great bargain for a good tea.
780	5	These chocolates are absolutely delicious and bring back memories of family gatherings when they were always a special treat.  So glad to know they are available now through Amazon and that they are as good as ever.
781	2	We'd been getting Greens Puffs for a while now for our 12 month old, and he used to love them - in fact, he couldn't get enough of them. However, based on our most recent shipment, the puffs are now smaller and mostly have a much thicker green powder coating than they used to. I gave my son the new puffs, hoping he'd like them just as much, but alas, now he really doesn't like them. He'll take a bite of a few, and then he just starts throwing them on the ground. I tasted one to see what the difference was, and honestly, I don't blame him for not liking them.  They have a sort of citrus flavor, and do have a really odd smell, almost like seaweed or seaweed flavored foods. I used to have a subscription for these, but I've cancelled it and now I have a box of six containers of these puffs that I don't know what to do with. Happy Baby shouldn't have messed with a successful formula. I used to like that he was getting something a little different, but we're just going to stick with Cheerios from now on.
782	5	I got hooked on K-cups at a customer's plant where I was working.  The coffee was so fresh and great tasting the I was compelled to buy this unit for my home.  It has not failed my expectations.  It has worked flawlessly since I first plugged it in.  The touch screen is a conversation piece when guests are in the kitchen because it rolls through various views of coffee beans, roasting, and the k-cup brewing cycle.  When you put a new k-cup into the holder it shows the screen to select your brew size, then all you have to do is select the size and hit the 'brew' button and you've got a superior cup of coffee.<br />Even the kids love brewing up a cup of hot cocoa.  And, if you don't like coffee or cocoa, try the chai latte (spiced black tea).  There are k-cups available that will please anyone.
783	5	Our Ruby is a tad over ten yrs old and, although our Vet said try Science Light, the only kind of that available was for cats 6 yrs and under.  Then I saw the Royal Canin Light.  She's dropped 0.3 of a pound in a little over two weeks. Which is cool 'cause she likes to leap from her condo onto my lap. And the Vet says she likes this food.  It is a bit pricier, but Amazon has a bargain for the 15 lb bag w/free ship.
784	5	I just discovered these tomatoes on Amazon.<br /><br />Unlike the previous reviewer, I have actually tasted these tomatoes . . . at lest a dozen times. I can buy them locally here in Chicago.<br /><br />They have an excelent taste. I use them on special occasions and with cetain recipies. They are much better than a half dozen other national brands of canned tomatoes. I don't find anything wrong the others. This is just a lot better.<br /><br />They are also less expensive then the real Italian D.O.P. certified San Marzano tomatoes, so I consider it a value buy.<br /><br />I'm not sure why someone who never sampled the product feels its appropriate to vent about it. Maybe its a disgruntled ex-employee?
785	5	My baby is almost 8 months old and she's showing an interest for finger foods. She hasn't learned the pincher grasp with her fingers yet so she can't feed herself cheerios but she sure loves to hold sticks of food in her hands. I try everything my baby eats and when I first tasted these, they reminded me of Cheetos. The cheddar flavor is very evident. Some pieces are small -- some even too short for her to hold -- looks like sizes vary slightly. She hasn't had any choking issues with these since they melt in your mouth fairly quickly. Sodium value is also fairly decent. I have noticed though that if opened (with lid on) for more than 1 week, it starts to become less crunchy and more on the chewy side.<br /><br />Nutrition Facts from label:<br />Calories 35, Serving Size 18 pieces, Servings per container 6, Sodium 50mg<br />% Daily Value for infants 0-1:<br />Protein 0%, Vitamin A 0%, Vitamin C 0%, Calcium 6%, Iron 10%, Vitamin E 20%, Zinc 15%
786	5	this is just the perfect thing to end a tired day.  the taste is smooth and warm and creamy.  i find that i look forward to having a cup while i read for a few minutes. what a treat.
787	5	Careful if you live overseas it may explode in your face a bit when you open it, it is still very good though and it arrived on time.
788	3	Only popped a couple pounds but seemed ok with some unpopped that is normal to me. We have a 6 oz paramount machine that i love to use for popping.
789	5	This candy is delicious!  I kind of wished I had ordered more of it.  The only problem for me is that the pieces are very big, which I think probably helps to keep them so fresh.  I can actually get five bites from one piece, but then I have a small mouth!
790	5	The mini-crisps are wonderful.  I love them because they are better for diabetics.  They are just sweet enough to cure that need for something sweet.
791	2	The seller states in the product description that the quantity of Kefir grains will be enough to make one cup of milk. The amount I received was just over a teaspoon and the seller's directions which came with it said to put it in a quarter of a cup of milk. The grains seemed rather delicate and I've been "babying" them for about a week now and still haven't been able to make a cup of Kefir. Their fragile state was probably in part due to the way they were shipped. They were put without any liquid in a tiny, sealed, thin plastic envelope which was placed in an un-padded, business sized letter envelope. The $5.49 shipping seems rather steep for two stamps and a remarkable lack of special packaging. If I had it to do over again I would probably order from somewhere else. That being said, I have been able to make Kefir--albeit in doll portions---and the flavor is good.
792	4	Pros:<br />Very complex<br />Rich<br />Excellent for doubles and triples<br /><br />Cons:<br />A bit expensive<br />Only adequate for singles<br /><br />Overall:<br />I very much like Black Cat Espresso. I consider it the bar against which other espressos are measured. I like it more than Kicking Horse, Lavazza, and Stumptown. Its flavor profile is very complex. It has its fair share of caramel and chocolate, but it also has a spicy, savory nature to it, and very fruity notes that come out well in singles.<br /><br />This is not a large-scale, homogenized coffee. Different regions and roasts result in different flavors from each bag. Sometimes that spiciness becomes a sort of salty flavor, and the fruits can turn very flowery. It is an easy espresso to make. Even shots that aren't perfect come out tasting pretty good. It's also a forgiving blend in that the shots are not prone to channeling.<br /><br />Singles are good, because any good coffee becomes light and toasty in a single, as opposed to the rich, crema-bombs of doubles and triples. Still, this espresso is very much intended for doubles or triples.<br /><br />In drip coffee, it's alright. And by drip, I mean any immersion process, be it French press, Aeropress, drip, pour-over, etc. The flavors get blown out, with the spices overwhelming the chocolates and caramels and resulting in a coffee that's not terribly smooth. Of the immersion processes, Aeropress tasted the best, probably because it most closely approximates espresso.<br /><br />Black Cat is a bit expensive, but not terribly so. Especially when one considers the increases in coffee as of late, -even Starbucks Tribute was $14 per pound- the price isn't crippling, but it is definitely above many other brands. You can save a little money by buying in five-pound bulks on Intellgentsia's website, but it's not a good idea to keep coffee beans around for that long when you can just as easily get it fresh.<br /><br />All said, Black Cat is espresso that more often than not finds its way into my machine.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />Something that I forgot to mention in my initial review is that Black Cat is a very complex blend. That means that cheap stepped grinders WILL NOT grind the coffee correctly for espresso. Some higher-end stepped grinders will do the job, like the Rancilio Rocky, but you'll want a good, stepless grinder to fine-tune the grind. This is especially important if you have an espresso machine that's very picky about grind.<br /><br />Finally, this is not a terribly cremariffic espresso, which means to get a good amount of crema out of it, and thus really have a good canvas for latte art, you're going to have to prepare triples.
793	4	Great tasting coffee. Exactly the flavor it says. Not too much flavor, but perfect. Great dessert coffee. Very pleased and will purchase again!
794	5	perfect plant, and received it very quickly. i would definitely buy from this seller again, i am very satisfied!Yes! so excited to give this as a gift
795	4	I would give it 5 stars but deducted a star due to questionable quality. There were white spots all over the sweet potatoes which worried me as they looked like bacteria or something. I emailed the company and they told me that they had already tested it in a lab and it was found to be starch, which occurs naturally on sweet potatoes. But I still feel uneasy about giving it to my dogs. Why wouldn't they post this info on the bags then?????
796	5	Super quality and quantity, especially considering the bargain price.  Items arrived in time for Valentines, even though it was ordered just a few days before & coming cross-country.  Superb value for the money!  Thank you!!
797	5	Ordered during the day, got it during the next morning.  Excellent quality, and well-packed.  A little pricey, but don't eat it like Hershey's, and savor it.
798	5	My 10 lbs chihuahua/doxie mix is a picky eater.  He isn't motivated by food at all, and it's always a trial and error when it comes to trying out a new treat.  His treats of choice are freeze-dried tripe, freeze-dried liver, freeze-dried chicken - you get the idea.  The boy has expensive taste - lol.<br /><br />That said, since he's now nearing the 9 year old mark, I wanted to begin giving him Glucosamine and Chondroitin for his hips and joints.  I started to notice that he has become a little reluctant to jump up on the bed, preferring to be helped up.  I think this is happening due to getting older. My usage of these treats is to help with prevention - better to start early before it's too late, you know?<br /><br />Feeding him pills is a hassle, and I'm already giving him globs of peanut butter a day to hide his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015GS0BY">Nutri-Vet Healthy Vision Canine Chewables</a> (I highly recommend these pills if you have a dog with vision issues).  Anyway, my quest for a non-pill form of Glucosamine and Chondroitin led me to Zuke's Hip Action.<br /><br />I love that it's wheat, corn and soy free.  My boy has skin allergies and I've been doing my best to keep his diet as clean as possible.  Each treat has 300 mg of Glucosamine and 50 mg of Chondroitin.  The treats also have antioxidants thanks to cherry, blueberry, rosemary, turmeric and seasame seed.  BTW - turmeric is a great Indian spice that also helps humans because of its anti-inflammatory benefits.  It also has egg shell membrane meal, which according to the package helps support joint health.  So, it has good stuff in it.  It's also made in the USA.  After all the issues with Chinese-made dog treats, avoiding treats from China is important to me and the health of my dog.<br /><br />For a small 46 lbs and under dog (like my Ozzy), only one treat is necessary per day.  For a medium dog of 98 lbs and under, 2 treats a day is necessary.  For a giant dog of 138 lbs and under, 3 treats are needed per day.  Each package has about 23 treats in it.  If you have a larger size dog, it definitely can get pricey.<br /><br />I feed Ozzy the peanut butter flavor, because, well, peanut butter is one of his favorite things in the world.  Each treat is square and has a moist look to it.  It has an interesting smell - not one of my favorites, but not completely a turn-off either.  Just...interesting.  But the best part is he LOVES them.  His eyes actually bug out more than the usual chihuahua buggy-eyed look, and he happily grabs it and runs off to enjoy it.  He looks forward to it every day.<br /><br />Ozzy recently had surgery on his ear, and during the time after his surgery, he was pickier than ever with food.  He refused to eat even the raw beef patties that he usually loves.  He barely even took the peanut butter hiding his eye vitamins, probiotics and antibiotics (and this is a dog that loves peanut butter)  But these Zuke treats?  Heck yeah! Never a problem.  Just goes to show how much he loves these treats.
799	5	I have a 5 year old lab mix who has always had trouble with excessive scratching, self-chewing, and shedding during the wintertime.  We tried all the special oils in his foods, had multiple vets check him out, and no one had the answer.  Finally, about a year ago, it started happening in the summer too, so we decided to do an elimination diet to see if he was allergic to anything.  We would give him 2-3 weeks on a limited ingredient food and watch for improvement, and if there wasn't improvement, we moved on to the next one. Royal Canin was the last one we tried because well, it was the one that finally worked! He still scratches and sheds some, but no more than an ordinary dog.  The obsessive chewing has stopped.  He has been on Royal Canin for 7 or 8 months now and we've been very pleased.<br /><br />I also love that the kibbles are large and hollow, forcing him to bite into it and chew rather than just guzzling down food- I am sure this helps his teeth and digestive system, now that he is forced to actually chew his food! It is on the high end price wise, but compared to the money I spend on food for my 2-legged children, it is nothing. One bag lasts him just under a month (he is about 80lbs), and with free shipping through prime, it is cheaper than driving to a pet store to buy it there.  Will be re-ordering every month!
800	5	I have a shorkie and she just loves these treats.  When we got her as a puppy, our Wal-mart handled these treats and she liked them from the beginning.  After she was hooked, our Wal-mart stopped handling them and Amazon is the only place that I have found. I would advise any pet owner to try them for their dog. I have gave a bag to my mother and to the neighbor for their dogs and both dogs love the treats too.
801	1	I have ONLY fed my 3 dogs Canidae since 2002. Until 3 days ago we have HAD no problems at all, and I had highly recommended the food to everyone who would listen. That is NO longer the case.<br /><br />Recently, Canidae decided to change the formula, and without any notice being placed on the bag.  Two weeks into the first, and LAST bag of Canidae I will every buy, one of my dogs began chewing his feet. Prior to 3 days ago, he had never had a "hot spot" or anything close to it.... And now I cannot get him to stop chewing his red, soaking wet paws. One expensive vet bill later, the vet said it is an "allergic reaction."  Allergies??!! I do not want my dogs to be miserable with allergies!!<br /><br />Besides the constant chewing, not one of my dogs has had a firm stool since their first meal with the new formula. One of my dogs is prone to anal glad issues, and so it is critical that she have a firm stool.<br /><br />In addition to my issues, my breeder, who recommended the food to me, and who has been feeding her dogs Canidae for much longer than I, has taken her dogs off the food. Why? Her dogs became violently ill, vomiting non-stop, itching, acting lethargic. She has contacted the MANY, MANY people she knows who use Canidae, and they have all had issues, many have taken their dogs to the vet, and have all now switched to a different food... not made by Canidae.<br /><br />It's too bad they chose to make this change; they have lost countless loyal customers over trying to save money on rice. I can't imagine they will be in business much longer.<br /><br />******** UPDATED 10/2/08 : I've moved all my dogs to California Natural. My breeder has also switched her dogs to California Natural. So far everyone is doing great... after the Canidae got out of their systems.
802	5	Not only does my cat love these, the packets make sure you get everything out and the chicken ones are low smell (unlike the sardine and mackerel ones that are her favorite).
803	5	So I was looking for more snacks and got the gummies. Was pleased to get this earlier than I imagined. I have been looking to lose weight and try and live healthier in general and know fruits are good to try and these low fat gummies can really help me lose weight. I am not at all diabetic and tried the fruit before too I think, along with the mandarins oranges (kind of like those). This is tasty and I want to try this flavor more often. I just have to start being responsible when it comes to my weight and my cholesterol. Not that I am an overeater just am happy to get something sweet that isn't as fattening but very good to have around when I get hungry. I get hungry and reach for more. Very flavorful. I couldn't be happier and I eat candy and sweet things whenever I want so I know what I'm talking about. Do try if you are searching for snacks or candy you want to make sure you have a bag. It's so unique of a flavor and in a good way not like anything you wouldn't really enjoy the flavor is amazingly good.
804	3	My 13 months old son generally liked the concept of eating by himself but not this combination of beet, berry and banana. It tastes sour probably
805	5	I have been using the CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo for about a week. It comes in a 12.9 ounce bottle with convenient flat ends on both top and bottom, which means that when the bottle starts to empty, it can be stored on its top in order to get the remaining contents out easily. The ingredients include: ginseng, mint, and tea tree.<br /><br />The shampoo itself is a milky cream which emerges readily from the container. The shampoo is not oily or greasy and appears not to leave residues. Any odor is not apparent to me.  After one week of use, my scalp feels clean. My hair tends to curl, especially in the rain-forest environment where I live.  However, this shampoo seems to flatten my curls.  You may or may not like that effect.  On the negative side, the shampoo is irritating if you get it in your eyes.  Maybe this is caused by the mint.  Altogether, I like this shampoo and plan to continue to use it.
806	1	I bought these after seeing the chocolate pasta on the cooking network. She made her own but I didn't have the time to make the pasta so I thought this would be the same. Boy was I wrong...it's bland and tastes nothing like chocolate. You are better off using normal pasta instead of this.
807	1	Instant coffee can be good tasting; Mount Hagen has misses the mark.  Mount Hagen tastes like freeze dried coffees of old.  Nescaf&eacute; makes a good tasting dark roast instant coffee, unfortunately it's not organic and won't be any time soon.  Such is life.
808	5	I have been a Stash Tea fan for years.  The price on Amazon Grocery is terrific, and yes, you will drink your chai every day throughout the winter!  Try the regular or decaf chai with a tablespoon or two of real cream--it's the perfect drink for those chilly days.
809	5	It is the best hot pot!!!!!! forever !!!!!!!!!!!!<br />It is the best hot pot!!!!!! forever !!!!!!!!!!!!<br />It is the best hot pot!!!!!! forever !!!!!!!!!!!!
810	5	what can i say about this product that you don't already know, you order for a specific reason, and from whoelse but royal danske the best plus the tin is reusable.
811	5	Mix 1/2 teaspoon of Ranch flavored seasoning with 1/4 cup of cream and 2 tablespoons of mayo for a yummy creamy salad dressing. (single serving)<br /><br />I've also tossed my greens with a little olive oil and then sprinkled on the Ranch seasoning for a healthier, lower calorie dressing.  Make sure you mix your salad just before eating or your greens will wilt.<br /><br />Tastes great and no MSG!
812	1	When you consider the shipping charges, these items are up to $12 a box as compared to $2.50 to $3.00 a box on sale in Retail supermarkets, Wal-Marts, etc.  If you are luckY enought to be located near a Hostess Outlet Store, the same products can be had for 3 Boxes for $5.00.
813	5	We were browsing Amazon's Gold Box deals when we came across this four-pound box of treasure. Our family does a lot of holiday baking, sharing gift baskets filled with cookies, candies, and dessert bars and breads.<br /><br />These simply are outstanding cherries. They are tart and firm with a richness that we don't find in bulk foods stores. Both of our sons tried the cherries and gave us their "GG" thumbs-up review (that's "Good-Good" according to the under six-year old audience).<br /><br />We're thrilled with both the quality and the price of the Traverse Bay dried cherries. Since we're members of Amazon Prime (highly recommended!) shipping was simple.<br /><br />Of course, we're used to buying dried fruits in smaller quantities. We opened the boxy and divided all four pounds into individual sealed bags that can be stored in the refrigerator, the freezer or in a cool, dry cabinet. That was a piece of cake.<br /><br />In summary, if you are planning some holiday baking or other recipes that call for dried cherries, this is an excellent buy with a quality that will have you coming back for more.
814	5	This tea is a "must" for nursing mothers.  It really does help to increase milk production, and would always help my baby spit up less.  Tastes awful, but you get used to it.  Recommend for all nursing moms who are concerned about their "supply."
815	5	This is one of the best products on the market.  It promotes healthy gums and white teeth on my dog.  She loves these things and I am happy that she likes them so much, because it keeps her happy and her teeth sparkling!
816	1	Really had high expectations of this Kona coffee--so much so that I even gifted a couple of bags for Christmas.  I was not impressed and very much regretted gifting this coffee.
817	5	It had been years since I tried this product and it lived up to every expectation as to how I remember it. The best way to enjoy brown bread is with cream cheese on top. It is a shame that this product is not more widely available in local stores. It is truly a classic.
818	5	These are a much healthy alternative to most chips and they taste great.  They have a great crunch and flavor and don't have that bad after taste that most baked chips have.  My only regret is that I didn't order more when they were on sale there all gone now but even at regular price are worth it.
819	5	Coffee drinkers have very individual tastes, but for my wife and me this is the best tasting hazelnut coffee that we have ordered. It has a nice aroma, distinctive hazelnut taste that is not too weak or too strong, and a very smooth taste (not bitter at all). This is a great coffee to start your day or to enjoy with some cake or pie for dessert.<br /><br />When I ordered the 50 count pack, I didn't realize that the K cups came loose in a big box. That is not a convenient way for me to store them, so next time I will probably order two 24 count boxes that I can stack up in my closet along with the other K cup flavors that I have.<br /><br />The current price on Amazon of $29.99 is about the same as on various internet sites, but as a Prime member I don't pay shipping (as you have to do on the internet sites unless you spend a certain amount that is much more than the cost of this product), so for me it is a good deal.
820	5	The ingredients are: pear, broccolli, spinache, lemon juice, and Vitamin C (absorbic acid).<br /><br />That's pretty much what I put in his homeade purees, except the absorbic acid, which is a perfectly safe ingredient.  My 8 month old loves this stuff.  And it's green, which is awesome.<br /><br />And I love the pouch.  It makes it really easy to have on the go -- you can squeeze out just enough to put on a spoon (or my finger when I'm in a pinch), and the spout is safer than a jar because there's less room for contaminants to get in.<br /><br />And I've tasted it myself -- it tastes good!  I mean, I'm not personally going to snack on it, but it tastes like what it is -- broccolli, spinach, and pear, and all those are pretty good-tasting foods.<br /><br />Recommended.
821	5	The label says "...has a strong rich flavor with overtones of caramel and malt."  I call it a smoky flavor and found the perfect use for it-- BBQ.  Now I use Airborne brand Manuka honey exclusively to make BBQ tofu and chicken with a little garlic and red pepper.  Delicious!!  No other honey will do.
822	5	It is tough to find allergen-free snacks that taste and have the texture of regular foods.  These Outback Animals are  just  like regular animal crackers.<br />My child loves them.  I give them to other kids who don't have food allergies and they like them too.  The individual snack packs make them convenient for lunch boxes.  We get both the vanilla and chocolate flavors.
823	5	I was raised on a farm where we raised our own asparagus along with other vegetables.<br />I have purchased two cases of this asparagus - and have been very pleased with the contents<br />and taste. Each of us has our own palate preferences - and I consider myself to be on the<br />fussy side - so, don't understand the negative reviews. Besides good flavor - a good way to<br />enjoy an economical source of nutrients.
824	5	To mix one cup liquid milk with Carnation, Saco, or Sunney Select use 1/3 cup (3-1/2 ouces) powder.<br /><br />W`ith this product (Bobs Red Mill) use 1 ounce of powder (2 tablespoons).<br /><br />Therefore this product stores more compactly, don't let the small container size fool you.<br /><br />This product also makes a better tasting drinking milk.<br /><br />Unfortuneately it does not mix up as easily as the other brands.<br /><br />Two out of three!<br /><br />-----<br />I found a way to mix this easy in 2 seconds:use the Aerolatte Milk Frother. Longer will whip it, one second does it! No stirring or shaking can do this like this thing can!<br /><br />[...]
825	5	These can were packed very well had had NO dents. This was a great value and I would purchase again. I purchased it for my dogs but will also use in baking.
826	3	I would've thrown the whole bag out if not for my convection oven. My first microwave batch turned out HORRIBLE. 1/2 cooked and no puffy/fluffy pieces at all! I popped some onto my infrared NuWave oven and they puffed up after 8 mins. FINALLY- something edible and YUMMY!<br />Glad they are healthier than the MSG/other additive types of rinds, but kinda high maintenance as far as how to properly prepare them. I think I will try to find easier-to-prep ones...bummer.
827	5	These were very yummy and would recommend them to everybody and well worth the price! I will be checking out more of their products for sure!
828	5	I love this stuff.  Started a low carb diet and was looking for a better sweetner that didn't upset my stomach/gi tract.  This is really great and the flavors are terrific.  Made myself a cream soda with a little bit of club soda, a few drops of vanilla cream and a few drops of valencia orange!  Highly recommend to try out sweetleaf sweeteners!!
829	5	Great canned Salmon.  My husband only buys this brand, and has never been dissapointed. Assorted sizes and easy to store and eat whenever you wish.  No oily taste.  Premium quality!  Thank you!
830	5	I've tried lots of different cappuccino mixes and by far and away this is my favorite! I like that it's sugar free and has no trans fats so I can enjoy it without feeling like I'm going to have to slog through extra long workouts or that I'm hopelessly clogging my arteries.<br /><br />I have a fairly large mug and I make it using two mounded teaspoons of Cafe D'vita Sugar Free Mocha, 2 scant tablespoons of fat free coffee creamer and about 1/4 teaspoon of instant coffee. Very satisfying. I drink it almost every day and don't have to feel guilty if I have more than one cup in a day.
831	5	If you want your pet's to live a long healthy life don't just feed the Wysong food learn about thier Wysong Optimal Health Program.  Visit the website at www.wysong.net and buy direct from the manufacturer.<br /><br />They will send you free information on how to properly feed your pets.  Dr. Wysong's book "THE TRUTH ABOUT PET FOODS" is a must read also if you have pet's.
832	5	This cocoa is extremely hard to find and it's my mom's favorite.  I am so excited to be able to subscribe to a monthly delivery for her.  What a super idea!!!
833	5	I'm surprised by the review "T. Bates" has left because I think these Nairns dark chocolate chip oat biscuits are delicious.  I have to wonder if s/he has had oat cakes before, because, if so, s/he would have known to expect a somewhat rough, rustic, hearty, and not overly sweet biscuit.  These are nothing like the typical cookies one can buy in American grocery stores.  I love the rich grain taste and texture and the subtleness of the dark chocolate chips.  These are more of an "adult" European biscuit and less of a true cookie.  They are definitely something good for those of us looking for a less processed, different cookie rather than the same old tired options available at the supermarket.
834	5	I started my dog (daschund) on this food because of a skin problem.  Since changing (I had used Purina One for sensitive systems), she has had no problems with scaling and redness on her back and legs.  She has had no issues with liver but does drink more water which is probably a plus for her skin as well.  I will be using Wellness Small Breed from now on.
835	4	This makes a tasty quick meal, it is a bit sweet for my taste, so I added a touch of chili oil. Not earth-shattering, but really not bad at all for a quickie microwaved meal or snack.
836	5	I am on a low salt diet,but most pretzels are covered with salt.I was unable to find these at my local store.I was happy to find these on Amazon.com.They came in good condition and very fresh.Snyder's make good pretzels.
837	4	While I usually eat granola bars for a quick snack, they're not especially good for you nutritionally.<br /><br />I decided to try something different and went with the Fruition Strawberry bar.<br /><br />They're 160 calories with 20 calories from fat. They have very low sodium and are vegan to boot.<br /><br />I like the taste a lot, it has a definite fruity taste and isn't sickeningly sweet or cloying like some of the granola bars I've had in the past. The texture is soft and moist and won't leave a ton on crumbs in your lap as you snack. I like nibbling a bit as I drink my tea.<br /><br />Since they're soft and moist, they stand up to being in a jacket pocket or a backpack and won't disintegrate into a pile of crumbs as you hike.<br /><br />One warning: they're more likely to appeal to the adult palate, both of my kids vastly prefer the sweet granola snack bars. Don't be disappointed if your kids aren't enamored with them.<br /><br />Bottom line: tasty, good for you and hiking friendly.
838	4	This chili has GREAT consistency, which is not easy in a vegetarian product.  It's fantastic for you, and I always enjoy it.<br /><br />That said, it's not spicy.  The previous reviewer might think it's hot in Michigan, but here in Texas, we would call this medium, maybe even mild.  You can resolve this easily with your favorite hot sauce.<br /><br />I would give this five stars if it were actually spicy.
839	5	Great Service and good price. Arrived in a very timely manner.I can't buy this easily where I live.I have found that when I can't get something Amazon ALWAYS comes through,
840	5	Great for training. Also perfect for stuffing in green Everlasting Treat Ball (another great product, especially for big chewers like my pitties). Love these healthy, perfectly sized treats!
841	5	If you use the Dolce Gusto machine Amazon is the place to buy the coffee. You'll get the best price and super fast shipping. And if you setup a subscription for the coffee you'll even get a better price!
842	5	I like the light Peppermint flavor. I usually use it with a regular Black Tea bag and<br />it really taste Good. Makes a great after breakfast tea, too get the day started..:)
843	5	Ever since I started marathon running I've been searching for a calorie supplement. Ive tried the gels, goos and cubes but was never satisfied. The cubes are too big and its hard to breath while chewing them. The goos and gels are just too dessicating, its like putting peanut butter in my mouth and I need to get something to drink to wash it down.<br /><br />The jelly beans are the best yet. They are smaller making it easier to breath while running. they do not dry your mouth and they also taste good, aways a plus. They provide 100 cals per pouch and contain no caffeine.<br /><br />That said it is not the perfect product. The package can be difficult to open while running and occasionally a few beans drop out as you are trying to negotiate them out of the bag and into your mouth. Also they should make a variety pack. 24 packs is enough to last me a month and I prefer to buy only one at a time. The same flavor, while good, can get a little boring. They have other flavors, a variety pack should not be too hard to make.<br /><br />Enjoy your exercise!
844	5	These are some very tasty little buns that ate great with sugar free syrup for a pancake like breakfast or between meal snack!
845	5	I love this tea.  It is like the coffee of teas!  Strong brew, it has a malty taste I love. I've tried other Irish Breakfast teas and keep coming back to this one, other brands seem weak in comparison.
846	4	I enjoyed my first brew. It's not as pungent as the other dark roast I ordered, but satisfying and mild.
847	5	This cereal had been a favorite for awhile. In the stores around here, it costs as much as $4.79 per box.  Occasionally, it was on sale at kroger, but never as low as Amazon. I bought 12 boxes!
848	5	A lot of K-cups say they are strong. I've tried many - Emeril, REVV, GM French Roast, etc. Many have a weird side taste or are bitter.<br /><br />Not Black Tiger! It is strong and smooth and my go-to when I need the caffeine kick-in-the-pants. I hope they never stop making this product.
849	5	The nuts came on time and they have all been eaten up. It was for a Christmas present and he loved them.
850	5	This is the best steal cut oats.  Sure, you can buy cheaper "bulk" oats at the health food store, but they wont be Irish oats.  These are the best and so good for you. I add 1tbls of brown sugar and that is just enought to enhance the flavor.  My spouse adds a tbls of peanut butter for an extra boose of protein.  I love McCann's , totally worth the price.
851	1	I ordered this because I wanted a taste of home.  I live overseas and I am a big pepperoni and jerky fan. I was disappointed in what i got.  The quality is at best average and because of this it is greatly overpriced.  It would have been overpriced at half the price. Next time i will have someone go to 7 eleven and buy some for me.  It will be cheaper and better quality.
852	5	Chocolate and mint? Nothing better. I really like this drink! It is fine tasting plain but I really enjoy it with a little sugar and half/half. I like this better than coffee. Of course, I don't like coffee unless it has sugar and cream so maybe that is just me! But I definitely recommend this teeccino. It is the only one I buy because it is so good!
853	5	We have my son and his girlfriend, roommate, and roommate's girlfriend over at least every couple of weeks for dinner and game-night activities -- and every one of these Dassant cake mixes (yes, we buy all of them) bakes a perfect, 6-piece cake.  Top with ice cream or some berries and whipped cream, and it's the easiest, fastest, freshest, still-warm-out-of-the-oven dessert you can imagine.<br /><br />And this one -- the vanilla pound cake -- gets the biggest "ooohs and ahhhs." Delicious!<br /><br />If you've got one of the terrific 2lb Zojirushi bread machines, you'll need to create your own CAKE program because the pre-set cake setting from the factory will mix the ingredients for far too long and change the chemistry (gluten) of the cake.  I'm not sure who programmed this for Zojirushi, but they screwed up.  Instead, create a custom program that mixes for 7 minutes, and bakes for 62 minutes, with a medium brown crust.  This custom setting will work for any of the Dassant cakes (also works for other cake/muffin mixes, and for cornbread.)<br /><br />just dump the cake mix, butter, water, and eggs into the pan, turn on your custom program, and walk away.  I usually start the machine as everybody is starting to eat dinner so we have time to eat, talk, start a game or a movie -- and then enjoy the wonderful vanilla pound cake smell coming from the kitchen.<br /><br />All the other flavors are wonderful, too.  The Vanilla Bean Cake makes a really light, fluffy cake, perfect for adding strawberries and whipped cream for strawberry short cake.  Our other favorites are the applesauce cake, and the pumpkin spice cake.  And the brownies are also very good....<br /><br />No nuts, no MSG, no preservatives, colorings, partially hydrogenated whatever, or any of that unpronounceable stuff in the "old grocery store" brands.<br /><br />Excellent product!
854	5	I have a hard time finding this flavor of this brand of tea in my local stores. Wal-Mart carries it but the closest one is over 100 miles away. I was tickled to see Amazon carry this at such a great price. One of the reviews mentioned that this is not the same as the stores carry--they are wrong, it is exactly what you will find in stores. I have purchased this 2 times now thru Amazon & am sure I will purchase it again.
855	5	These were the most delicious caramel treats I have ever had! We devoured them as soon as they arrived at our doorstep, and they were incredibly fresh and chewy. Yum. I plan to order many more as Easter treats!
856	1	I tried this product out of curiosity since it was new.  It tastes like all the others but with a much higher price tag.  I am now at the point where I think bottled water is such a waste of money and natural resources - clogging landfills with all the bottles that no one recycles - that I am going to buy a water filter for my sink and just use that.  You can also buy packets of electrolytes from companies like Emergen-C and add them to your water.  I used those when I ran a marathon and they worked wonders!  Save a buck and save the environment...use filtered water in a bottle you can reuse.
857	5	Nesquik dissolves into cold milk completely. And it tastes great. The old "Nestle Quik" that I grew up with was slightly gritty (but a nice chocolaty kind of gritty). This Nesquik makes a tasty, smooth, creamy glass of chocolate milk. It also tastes great sprinkled on ice cream. It has no corn syrup like Hershey's Chocolate Syrup. It also has less sugar than Hershey's. In addition, it is fortified with calcium and vitamin C, among other things. If you grew up with Quik, you'll probably love Nesquik.
858	3	I love these cookies, but this paticular batch was stale, very hard, & I had to dip them in my coffe to eat them easily.
859	5	It's nearly impossible after a few days to get our dogs to take their pills. The first day you can stick it in some peanut butter and they're fooled. The next day they say no to PB but will eat it in salami. The third day maybe a dab of honey will do the trick. By the fourth day they won't eat anything with the pills in them....until Greenies came into our house! Never again will we have to worry about fighting with our dogs over taking their meds!!
860	5	These almonds taste good, not as well flavored as the cinnamon or vanilla flavored but a decent change of pace.  A little plain though.
861	4	All of the Snackimals varieties are a treat -- crunchy, satisfying, and fun to eat.  I like the Wheat-Free variety best, but vanilla is a close second.  Just be aware that the snack-sized bags are actually two-servings (for those conscious of sugar/cal intake), so don't forget to share and make those around you feel like kids too!
862	5	Both our cat and dog love these treats. I have tried pretty much all the different treats and these seem to be their favorite. All I have to do is shake the bag and both come running. A bonus is buying them through Amazon at the cheapest price I have found.
863	5	like batavia black tea this tea is far superior to all other teas that i have found i especially enjoy it when i use one black tea bag and one green tea bag to the cup highly recommend this tea
864	3	The coffee in the box varied from a great, dark and complex brew to a really funny smelling, weird flavor.
865	5	These beans arrived quickly and the quality was fantastic!  The beans were moist and easy to use.  The flavor was amazing and I will definately be ordering these beans again.
866	5	These chews are a wonderful product and they really work!  The have a tooth cleaning product embedded in the rawhide that continues to work for 24 hours!
867	5	Maybe not, but these bars are my JAM, yo!  Cashew cookie is my fave flave.  I like the ingredients list: "Cashews, dates."  No foolin'!  These bars is for real!  I eat one while I drink my coffee every dang morning.  I eat one after I run (good carb:protein ratio, and lot's o'potassium).  Potassi... yum!  Some flavors aren't my favorite, so don't be judgin' if you've only tried one flavor.  Like apple.  Not that good.  I tend to like the nutty ones (I think that applies to women, too).  Pecan Pie, Peanut Butter Cookie, Pistacio.  Pistaci, yo!  And the Chocolate Coconut is good too- but don't expect it to taste like a chocolate bar from 7eleven because these bars is sweetened only by dates- they gots no added shoogs!  RE-SPEC!!  I buy in bulk.
868	3	I had many a k-cup but at 1.29 a piece. I'll just take my refill cup to the store and let someone else make me a cup. I have bought k cups on sale for as little as .54 a piece. Green mountain is one of the better coffees but lets be realistic with the price huh.
869	5	We use taco type seasoning quite a bit and it seemed I was always running out and replacing those little jars.<br />This mix has good flavor and assures that I'll have it on hand for quite awhile.  Very handy.
870	4	My 6.5 month son enjoyed this flavor and it helped him with his bowel movements as well.
871	5	This K-cup saved my K-cup maker from extinction. I was used to dark, strong brewed coffee and none of the K-cups I tried up to this one could provide that. Jet Fuel is strong and dark and has a slightly sweet aftertaste and is not at all bitter. It is awesome.
872	5	My cat loves these lures, especially the one with the red fuzzy hair.  I only wish the fishing pole itself lasted as long.  Oh well.
873	5	Gum is gum.  How can you go wrong.  Bought this as a gift for Christmas from the Amazon List on file and person was thrilled to get it.  Liked it very much.
874	5	Saw on Dr. Oz that Lingonberries are a superberry, but the only place you can find them is Sweden.  Have ordered a couple different brands,both very good.
875	1	This item is a PDQ try item per amazon, and has 8 bags in each tray. I place order received 1 bag, contacted amazon and I said if it was actually suppose to be 8 bags I would like a replacement, they issued a replacement and I received 1 bag again. They told me to keep 1st bag so now with 2 bags I got my moneys worth. Beware description is wrong, regular price at walmart is a little over 3 per bag.<br /><br />On a better note, dingoroos are the only treat my dog will eat, glad to see dingo brought them back.
876	5	My dog, and the local animal shelter dogs, love these! Healthy and a good price on sale!
877	4	its a little on the dry side but if you use a spray butter on it, it turns out very well and jam, yummy!!
878	5	This critter serves several purposes. First, as my cats will point out if you sit on the box you own it (cat rules). Second, when the box is empty, and if you are big enough you can be stuck in it.<br /><br />This tasty meal in a pop-top can, reminiscent of C rations takes some strength and skill to open so you will not hear the sound of lids pealing back in the middle of the night and cats slurping the juice.<br /><br />Some cats rub on the hand that opens the can. Others wait until you are out of sight before you hear them devouring the tasty can innards. Bottom line is this product is part of a balanced diet and has yet to encounter any detractors.
879	5	Simply the BEST hot chocolate outside of Europe.<br />Very good price at Amazon and quick delivery<br />Rich and creamy--add a splash of cream or half and half after  following directions on the packet.<br />Amazon is the only place I can find this product anymore. GET some. You'll be glad you did.
880	5	These are my little brother's favourite Skittles, and since we now live about 2100 miles apart I figured this would make an excellent birthday present! Free super saver shipping and a large quantity of skittles, one cannot go wrong =)
881	1	I bought this locally today as I had run out of Satin Ice.  It is NOT white it is yellow. I bought it to make a blue baby shower cake.  Of course the minute I added blue coloring it turned peppermint green, no good at all for my baby blue shower cake and $40.00 wasted.  How would you ever use this for a white colored cake?
882	5	Great tea! I searched all over for this product and couldn't find it in any local stores. Best price online was through Amazon.com. Very tasty tea - excellent in a london fog!
883	5	I bought this product to use with a stovetop espresso maker in making homemade Cuban coffee products. It is as authentic as you can get! I grew up in Miami and the Cuban coffee stands were a staple. I live in Jacksonville now and there is nothing authentic in the city. This takes me back and is an enjoyable brew, but any other standards.
884	5	These are delicious. I will buy them again and again. They are not for everyone, but if you like wasabi peas, you will love these. The flavoring works great with the taste of almonds.
885	5	These treats are great! They're yummy! They have such a perfect consistency, not too hard, not soft at all. They don't get gummy when they're chewed for awhile so mom doesn't mind picking them up after they've been chewed on for a bit. Sometimes she has to do that 'cause we get obsessed with chewing them on occasion and we just won't put them down! (OK, I admit, that's me..."Banshee". I am a Himalayolic but I don't need help. I just need more Himalayan Dog Chews and mom found them at Amazon.com for the best price anywhere!)<br />These treats are hard and crunchy and stay that way, they only get a tiny hint of softness as chewed. We have to work at it but small pieces flake off and we get our tasty reward! They make great dental bones because they have more flavor and have stiff edges to help rub along our teeth and break off the tarter. Oh, and they don't have the foul odor of hoof chewies or some others. Mom and dad gag when we chew hoofies but they love the Himalayan Chews.<br />Did I say they are great? Well I meant they are outstanding! They are wonderful and all three of us love them so much that on occasion we have fought over them. That's because "Zac" likes to horde them and tries to hide them all. He's stopped that now since mom worked with him. That's great because now she can leave 4-5 out, (more than the number of dogs is smart), without worry of a fight.<br />One warning is that you should watch your dog as they get down near the end of the chew. "Li" is a real aggressive eater and when he gets to that last inch he'll swallow it whole! One of these times I'm worried it may get stuck in his intestine and require surgery since I'm uncertain how well a large chunk will be digested. Regular chunks appear to be fully digested since it never hurts going poddy and mom never complains about chunks in our poops, BOL (Bark out loud).<br />We've been receiving these fine treats since they first came on the market and we've had no trouble. We (mostly) are average to above average chewers with lots of experience with these chews and we'd recommend you try them with your dogs. Like any chew, you should stick around and observe us as we chew but for light to moderate chewers you might be watching for hours and even then we may not finish one since it's highly dependent on the aggressiveness of the chewer. Crazy mad chewers like "Li" have been known to bite down on even the large ones and snap it in two, which is great 'cause then I get another one! Our mom watches us well and picks the chews up when she cannot watch us. I think that's smart for ALL chews. Now, go on! What are you waiting for? Go buy some for "Max" and "Hannah"!
886	4	This makes a great, quick spicy dip. I used fat free cream cheese and plain greek yogurt to reduce the fat and calories, and it still tastes yummy.
887	5	OK, I admit, if this hadn't been offered during an Amazon lightning deal I would not have bought it due to the high price.  However, this morning I opened a can to use for one of my dog's medicines.  Each of our three dogs got one-third of a can.<br /><br />And oh my, all three woofed it down and waited for more.  Even the cat chimed in and wanted some.  My dogs don't get this excited over canned Pedigree, which is what I usually feed them as a supplementary food source.<br /><br />Although the pureed liver comes out of the can looking and feeling like something that comes out of the back end of a dog, it doesn't smell offensive.  I'm just not used to these more organic ingredients:  liver, beef broth, minerals and vitamins.  This is definitely something I will buy more often for special meals.<br /><br />Interestingly, this product comes from Uruguay.
888	5	Honestly, the best chocolate mix drink out there. I drank this growing up and now that I'm pregnant, this is the only dairy beverage that I can keep down - and it's chok full of good vitamins and minerals! I love it cold, cold, cold.  Kudos - I wish that it was more readily available and in larger sizes.
889	1	My niece told me she would like a cup of "hot chocolate" since I was making myself a cup of coffee. I thought, I was about to give her the best hot chocolate had ever tasted. Boy was I wrong. First of all the cup is tiny I thought for sure the barcode reader malfunctioned or that I needed to run a milk disc through along with it. (I wasn't there when the package was opened, I thought it may be a "two-part" system.) Nope. That's what you're supposed to get, "A tiny, funky tasting cocoa." Save your money!!
890	4	we love this stuff....all their flavors.  i mix one of these with lots of quinoa, wild rice or brown rice or mung bean noodles and veggies.  1 3.5 box is quite spicy so mixed it's great flavor.
891	1	For those of you who, like me, had to order the Kettle Spicy Thai chips from Amazon because they are so hard to find locally, you will probably be aggrieved to know that the recipe has changed.  They are just like regular potatoe chips.  I paid for them but now my husband gets to eat them because he didn't like the spicy thai, but these are fine for him.<br /><br />Yuck!!!
892	4	I like to say my taste buds require a lot of flavoring so it might not be the norm. When I first ordered it I was hoping it would have a nice full taste, and not, for a lack of a better word, diluted flavor.  I was not disappointed. Not to say this tasted burnt like some coffee.  I'm really enjoying it and will order some more when the time comes.
893	5	These are so good! They almost taste like cake! Great for picky eaters.  And they are all natural and gluten free, doesn't get any better ;)
894	1	I recently purchased the On the Go Yamamotoyama Sweetened Iced Green Tea and was floored!  I bought it at a store that is far from me.  I was told I could find this brand at Ralph's. But when I went I could only find the Raspberry flavored one.  It was absolutely horrible compared to the one I had earlier, which is easily a 5 star review.  It was just weird tasting.  I would stick to the regular one and flavor it later.  Wow big fail.
895	5	tangy ginger flavor - very pleasing to the senses; only takes a small amount to make a delicious cup of hot tea or iced tea in a pitcher for the refrigerator
896	5	I would just like to say in short that this tea is wonderful to use at night. Lately I have been a little stress and have been experiencing light symptoms of insomnia due to premenopause,but thanks to this tea it really helps me relax.
897	4	The product works well, but it is the wrong size for the type of peanut butter jars we normally purchase.  The size of the peanut buter mixer was not specified in the ordering information.
898	5	I DO NOT EVEN CARE IF THIS IS OVERPRICED, THESE ARE ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. THERE'S NOT A TON OF MEAT IN EACH PACKAGE, BUT IT HITS THE SPOT. GOOD LORD, THESE TASTE SO DELICIOUS, I DO NOT EVEN KNOW WHAT MORE TO SAY.
899	4	Ok for the price that this is selling at you just cant beat it. I mean one of these bags will easily last you a month and thats if you make it like me and add about a 2 inch layer at the bottom of an 8-cup french press! So i was torn between giving this product a 3 and 4 and here is why. First off the tea is pretty much stem free like it says at least enough to satisfy me, second it has a great flavor even after i have been storing the bags in the freezer for the past 3 months. Anyways some of the cons are: after you open one bag you really need something to store it in until you finish it up because its pretty hard sealing them up after you open it, they have a lot of powder!! almost too much for my taste, but they never said powder free, and i dont mind too much i think it may even contribute to the stronger flavor of this tea. Next if you ever brew in a tea ball, you will have some pieces left in your tea, as there are a lot of fine pieces in this tea and tea balls seem to have a hard time of holding everything in. All in all its a great product! for the health benefits of Yerba Mate you need to drink a lot of tea so this is definitely a good product for that, and it taste pretty good not as high end as some but i would definitely rank it among my top favorite tea brands. That being said, a tip on how to make a mean cup of Yerba, get a french press put about an inch or two layer on the bottom, add in your nearly boiling water, mix, and let set for about 4 minutes then pour in a mug with a spoonful of Honey..its great! and an excellent alternative to coffee. Oh and if you dont have a french press and are thinking about getting one go for the 8-cup thats just enough for about 2 full mugs of whatever your drinking, and they make awesome cups of java too!!
900	5	I don't actually eat the macaroni and cheese in our house.  The kids do.  In an effort to improve the quality of life for all, I've been gradually switching us over to natural, organic, and whole grain products.  Macaroni and cheese finally got my attention.  We've tried other brands, but the kids really say this is the best and is far better than the Kraft.  What else can I say?  I don't feel as guilty, they still get what they want.  Life is good.
901	5	These cookies are so great! They are soft and chewy and taste delicious. I really love homemade cookies right out of the oven, but these taste just as good! Quaker sure makes a great cookie!
902	5	We buy the 24 pack of these on monthly auto ship for our little doggies. Cheaper than buying at WinCo. Amazing bargain!
903	3	The Newman's Own line generates some decent food products at reasonable prices.  This one, however, wasn't one of our favorites.  The "licorice" is a bit sticky, and left a sticky residue on our children's fingers.  The pieces are also relatively short.<br /><br />We do eat pomegranates from time to time.  This doesn't really taste strongly of fresh pomegranate.  The initial taste is reminiscent of a sweet-tart apple/pomegranate with berry, but the aftertaste is a little off.  Don't get me wrong.  It's not horrible or anything.  It just doesn't really live up to what we've come to expect from the Newman's Own brand.
904	5	I purchase both Zico and Vita, like both of it, but I think Vita is better in taste, zica kinda water down on taste
905	5	My dogs love these biscuits. So do my friend's dogs. After opening the box,  I transfer them all to a ziploc bag. This keeps the last one just as soft as the first one.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ILEITA">Blue Dog Bakery Natural Low Fat Dog Treats, Assorted Flavors, 20-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)[Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]
906	5	This stuff is amazing- I love water and drink a lot of it but I don't really do the sweet flavored drinks...this has just enough flavor without being overpowering. I take one to the gym every day and it is so tasty and calming...you won't like it if you are not a big mint fan but for me, it was a gem of a find!!
907	5	thank you for having on amazon, as usual Walmart gets you liking product then can't get in store anymore because they quit stocking. My dog loves this food, so not switching to something else Walmart!
908	5	Very nice coffee, taste as a coffee with a cacao flavor in the background. I really recomend this product to those people who like to drink a real coffee.
909	5	The flavor and strength is perfect for me. I like to have a very full cup at a time and with this coffee I run the Keurig large size setting followed by the small size setting (using the same K-cup) for a, full to the brim, delicious cup fo coffee.
910	5	I purchased this after scouring onc of my favorite sites [...]  about natural ways to deal with rough, dry, feet.  I get biweekly pedicures but that gets expensive!  One of the reviewers recommended applying coconut oil daily and you'll never have to worry about rough feet again.  I have to honestly admit that she was right!  I only get a pedicure for the pampering every couple of months no longer the necessity and because of the results I apply the coconut oil to my entire body after the bath and I can't believe the difference in my skin's texture.  It's unbelievable.  The only thing about this one is during the summer months you have to find a cool place in the house to keep this such as underneath the bathroom cabinet or in the linen closet because it will liquify.  As a mattef of fact I keep it in my bedroom during showering so the steam from the shower won't won't liquify it because once it liquifies it will eventually reharden at room temperature but the consistency changes which to me also changes the chemical structure in it or something because it just doesn't moisturize the same afterwards.  But I love, love, love this product.  It's a must have.  It's has a light, chocolate fragrance to it which is a plus.
911	5	The k cups arrived on time and all in one piece with no holes. I love having a selection to choose from!
912	5	These are our new favorite breakfast food.  FANTASTIC!!!!  We love them, and that's even after we're on our second set of 12 boxes.  The strawberry flavoring tastes real, not fake like regular pop tarts.  Overall, the taste is sweet but not overly so.  This flavor is better than the apple cinnamon, which we have also tried.  Definitely one of our best Amazon purchases ever.
913	1	I received the Zukes Chicken Mini's a couple of days ago. I opened the bag and the smell that came out of it was a sour almost vinegar smell, much like pickles in away. I fed the dogs one each then thought I better not give them anymore. I emailed the company and asked if that was normal. Matt the contact sent this message:<br /><br />Hi Kerrie-<br /><br />They are definitely strong in smell. If you have not smelled them before<br />they may seem a little odd smelling. The dogs think they are candy! They<br />should be perfectly fine. One thing to check is the bottom/underside of<br />the bag and make sure the "best by" date is still good. If that is in<br />range I would say everything is good to feed to your dog. Thank You for<br />your inquiry and for supporting Zuke's!<br /><br />Matt Porray<br />"Bone Counselor"<br />Customer Service<br />Zuke's<br /><br />They date on the bag is for November 2013 so they are well within the expiration date.<br />But I emailed a friend (who in the past has donated many bags of Zukes treats to the dog club I used to belong for training classes) and I asked her the same question she felt they were not safe to feed with them smelling sour (vinegar like). I had never fed the chicken flavor before.<br />I think Iwill be sending these back. I am very disappointed, I don't mind treats that stink I feed a freeze dried green trip treat those really smell. The Zukes didn't smell like something even dogs would eat.
914	1	I love amaretto creamer but this tastes bad. It has a bitter taste to it. It doesn't taste sour, just very bitter.
915	5	All the products are 1st class. I plan to order more items for auction at my grandsons school. Thats the best endorsement I can give. Best wishes
916	2	I generally like items from other Newman's product lines as they always seem to have a great, borderline decadent flavor.  So I was genuinely surprised at how disappointing this bar was.  I love dark chocolate and when given a choice will always choose it over milk chocolate, but I found this bar to be bitter, almost burnt tasting, and the texture was exceptionally gritty.  To be fair, dark chocolate isn't going to have the silky texture of milk chocolate, but that doesn't mean it should crumble in your mouth.  All in all a very disappointing experience.
917	4	I bought Hormel Real Crumbled Peppered Bacon not just as a topper for my salads--must...have...bacon--but I thought the real bacon bits would be a great addition to mashed potatoes, pasta, even omelets in a pinch.  The texture of the bacon is soft and chewy.  These are not imitation bacon bits, so you're not going to get crunch out of these.  You might be able to crisp them up by heating them in a skillet, but I haven't tried that yet.<br /><br />They add a lot of flavor to salads, but beware when cooking with this product.  It is VERY salty!  So before you add salt to your recipe, taste it first.  The salt from the bacon may be all you need.<br /><br />Aside from the salt factor, the bacon does have a nice, balanced peppery and smoked flavor that just does wonders to cheese dishes.  I especially liked it with my macaroni and cheese.  I didn't add it to the recipe but more as an afterthought once the casserole was done and it was a nice addition.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product as it's one of those items you keep in your cupboard for use in a pinch; and because it has a decent shelf life (my shipment had one year on it), you don't have to worry about buying in bulk.
918	5	Love them! I've used other brands and they didn't tear well. These are sturdy and tear off well. Worth the money!
919	1	I can still remember Captain Midnight sitting there in the uniform of an astronaut of the 50's (khaki shirt and black four-in-hand tie) telling me solemnly that I should drink my Ovaltine because it tasted good and it was good for me. It was, after all, brown and that meant it had to be chocolate, my favorite flavor.<br /><br />What the Uranus traveler never told me was that they were crystals that would sit at the top of the warm milk and never dissolve. Furious stirring with a metal tool called a spoon didn't do it, nor did trying to grind them up against the side of the cup.  Even using a tenderizer tool didn't work as I soon discovered that as you pushed it down the cup, the warm milk came up and out. You had to compromise by trying to round up the little critters on the spoon and that offered little comfort as the crunchy buggers didn't taste all that great anyway. To top it off, all you had left was warm milk.<br /><br />The jar of Ovaltine was also very resilient. It lasted a long time in our home. It was the same one. Even my father who liked the "old standbys" of Shredded Wheat and Corn Flakes we never ate, didn't go near this stuff.<br /><br />I only recommend this for those who have lost their taste buds through constant sword swallowing or that fire breathing trick.<br /><br />Captain Midnight, you lied to me!
920	2	I ordered a small bag of this to try out as we like popcorn occasionally.  Received it and followed the directions to pop it stovetop.  Lots of kernels left unpopped, but not an overly unacceptable amount.  Sprinkled some salt on it, and tried it.<br /><br />Not only ARE there hulls left on the popcorn, the popped amount is so small that all you can taste are the hulls!  Other reviews stated that this tasted sweeter than normal popcorn, and we have to disagree.  It tasted plain, and the hulls really bothered me.  Harder than normal popped corn, it was very disappointing.<br /><br />I'm very glad that I only ordered a small bag of this, as it will probably get thrown out.  Unacceptable to us and a waste of money.  Everyone's taste may vary, but we'll take normal-sized popcorn for our snacking needs.
921	1	I was greatly disappointed in this stuff. They call it cookies but it hard little chips that are tasteless. Save your money and buy something else.
922	5	Candy arrived practically before the shipping window even started, so the shipper is on top of orders.  The candy tastes really good, and I even got 5-6 extra pieces in my bag, which was a nice treat.
923	5	My dogs love Zuke's Hip Action Treats.<br /><br />I don't know if you realized it or not but the individual bags you were selling were cheaper than the three pack.
924	3	My dogs like these.  The only drawback is that the bite sized morsels tend to disintegrate, leaving you with about 1/3 bag of crumbs.  You can give the crumbs to the dogs, but its kind of a pain.
925	5	I like this dog food alot for my dogs and I change the flavor everytime they run out so they dont get board and the dogs really like the food
926	4	Pretty sure these are the only puffs that happy baby makes that are gluten free. For a baby with an allergy, these have been perfect. My one year old still eats them because she has no teeth.<br /><br />They do go stale in the container if your baby doesn't finished them in a few days.
927	5	Worth every penny. Expecially if you're on "core". Try making a guiltless Banana Cream Pie. Yummy!
928	5	Be sure to have something to drink along with these slightly sweet, particularly crunchy crackers.  The texture is rich with the variety of several grains, and the flavor is a delightful combination of the grains and a touch of honey.  These are my favorite TLC crackers, but I switch out with the other varieties regularly.
929	5	These bars were so good.  There were big pieces of macadamia nut in them and the mango taste was intense.
930	5	I got these cocoa cups based on my sister-in-law's recommendation.  It has a great flavor and is inexpensive.  Quite a good combination.  I'll be ordering more very soon.
931	3	I love these and my 8 month old loves them but I don't think the product canister does a good job of keeping them fresh.  It seems like they go stale VERY fast.  I don't think the baby cares but since I eat them with her it bothers me.
932	1	These are just awful.  I love all kinds of toasted cheese, but simply couldn't eat these.  Fed them to the dogs.
933	1	I have tried multi grain chips before, and these are the worst. Too thick, and not very tasty. And I bought a case. Dumb Me!
934	4	My dog is kinda hard to get interested in food.  I use this to get him to eat his dry dog chow.  He liked the bacon and the chicken flavors.  the other dog got the roast flavor since it didn't work on the picky dog.
935	5	good stuff not same sold most places because it has 2x of each which makes it more premium. good stuff... good muhcie food but only as good as the shipping and packaging. so far so good.<br /><br />thumbs up good bye
936	5	My fiance and I are just starting to experiment with gluten free mixes.  Of the products that we have tried, this was the first one that we said was a definite "buy again."  The pancakes taste like real pancakes and are good enough to serve guests that can have gluten.
937	5	From the moment you open the bag and smell this coffee, you know it's the real deal. And, you would never guess it's decaf.
938	5	I am aware that tea bags do not give the same flavour as looseleaf, but this stuff is still quite good, and unlike with looseleaf, I can carry a ziplock of teabags with me everywhere so I can  always have tea. These bags are pretty cheap too. I bought one and then split the box among 2 friends, so we each paid like 6 bucks for 40 tea bags. I had never tried Lady Gray before, but it is pretty good. The other three are all classics, and I love them too!
939	1	Others may love this k cup but I found it way too bitter.  I have to admit I don't drink that much bold coffee but have had a chance to try a few others and don't care for this one.  My Keurig only has the 8oz capacity and I took a cue from other users and run the bold k cups through twice to make 12 to 16 ounces depending on the type coffee.  Well even if I run this through twice at a total of 16 oz it is still too bitter... just not my k cup of coffee I guess but I do like Donut Shop and Newman's Own Extra Bold.
940	5	I use this when baking all seafood and as a touch when cooking almost everything else. It is middle level spice with a unique taste that is addictive.
941	1	These took FOREVER to ship and when they did arrive they were not as durable as advertized.  Was looking for a bone to keep our dogs busy, these were more like a snack.
942	5	I stick one of these in my toddler son's diaper bag.  Shelf stable, easy to transport, and he loves the taste of them.  Great product!
943	5	This is a great coffee if you like it a little on the strong side, but smooth.  I was surprised that it came in a plastic bag as opposed to a sealed box, but none-the-less, it was good.
944	3	I bought these a few days ago to try out for $5 for (1) 11 oz bag at Costco. They are edible but not great. The slices are too thick IMO making some really hard, I have found ends and many slices with the core still in it. These are pretty bitter as well. I think I would enjoy the red ones a lot more but am not sure if Costco carries those. Still well worth $5 though considering a reg. bag of organic chips aren't much less... the price on here is pretty nuts though! :(
945	4	XYLITOL and products sweetned with  xylitol<br /><br />I read on the internet  a warning for pet owners.  This product is not safe<br />for dogs  and I would probably include pets in general.<br />I think people need to be aware that dogs eat most anything  they smell,<br />so even the gum or sweets  made with this sweetner would be dangerous.
946	5	I purchased Chokecherry jelly at Amazon.com.<br /><br />Your Chokecherry jelly has the same taste that my mother's<br />Chokecherry jelly had.<br /><br />When all of her ten children ran around a farm in central<br />Minnesota, we were hungry when we came into the house for<br />something to eat. My mother baked her own bread twice a week<br />for her huge family.  Us children would lather the Chokecherry<br />jelly on thick slices of Mom's homemade bread.<br /><br />Reliving childhood memories through the sense of taste is<br />wonderful.<br /><br />I would like to see this jelly in a larger jar.<br />Please keep selling this Chokecherry Jelly I will be buying<br />more.<br /><br />Let me know if Chokecherry Jelly is ever on sale.<br /><br />Sincerely, Inez Lintz
947	5	Crazy Uncle Jester's Louisiana Firestorm is the best pure Louisiana style hot sauce, but Crystal is my favorite of the original style, milder Louisiana style hot sauces that I can buy in a supermarket.  It's about twice as hot as the original Louisiana style hot sauce, which still is not all that hot but the extra cayennes add a lot of flavor and are the difference between being 99% vinegar (like tabasco) and hot sauce IMO.<br /><br />I buy this one mainly for my 8 year old son, who hasn't yet migrated up to the hotter Louisiana style sauces and he loves it. I'll use it myself from time to time as well, although I usually opt for something hotter.  It's still good tasting.
948	4	These are my favorite type of Jelly Bellies. I had been eyeing this product for some time. After a few glasses of wine, I decided that this was a must buy because its price per pound was much lower than a single pound of this flavor. The price is still pretty high, but it is about the same price as buying 5 single pounds. I have been snacking on these for a few months. They are still around, and I still love them.<br /><br />The product arrived in a cardboard box with the jelly beans directly in the box. No plastic bag or anything, just the shipping box filled with jelly beans. I am not a huge germaphobe, but would have preferred a better container than the shipping box. This was the only reason why I docked it a star.
949	1	I took one bite of one of these things and had to throw all the rest of them away. The taste is indescribably yucky, sort of sweet yet caustic. The worst part is the TEXTURE! It was like trying to bite through soggy cardboard. Utterly disgusting. I guess if you were trapped in a collapsed coal mine and awaiting rescue and there was NOTHING else to eat, you might choose this over a coal-mine rat, but it would be a hard choice.
950	5	Love the fruit ropes.  Easy to pack around and easy to chew for little ones with few teeth.
951	5	I had very painful cramps with Very Heavy bleeding that lasted for 5 days! and this cycle repeated every 21 days! So I would have a full period twice a month!! I was miserable and had to schedule my life around my cycle, because I was doubled over in pain or afraid of the embarrasment of bleeding onto my clothes! A friend recomended drinking this tea and my life changed!! I no longer have ANY Cramps!! the bleeding has subsided to 3 days with a normal flow and now my cycle is regulated to every 26 days or once a month. I have more energy and vitality and dont have to call in sick anymore!! This tea is blessing not only for pregnancy but for your menstrual cycle as well!! I tell every woman I know about this tea!! No need for birth control pills or other hormonal intervention. I love its pleasant light taste and enjoy drinking a cup a day.
952	5	This Cashew Chicken kit has very good flavor and is easy to make.  It doesn't include enough rice for my taste, so I add another half cup (before cooking). It makes enough food for two adults.
953	5	These are the only lollipops my wife will let the kids eat because they are organic and you can't get these in the supermarket. Good price and good quality product.
954	5	When I recieved the 12 jars, I found two of the jars were not sealed properly.  The replacement jars were just fine.<br /><br />This product looks and tastes just like real honey.
955	5	We go through a lot of tea because we use four tea bags at a time to make Chai (Betty Crocker Recipe, if you want to try it, yum!). This is the best tea I've found to use. It has a great flavor, I love that it's organic, and it's very affordable. It arrives quickly, too! I highly recommend, and will continue to order regularly.
956	5	I love these!  I get a ton of energy without jitters and never crash; just wears off slowly.  I usually mix these up in bottles and throw them in the freezer a few hours before I'm going to use them.  They form ice much like a slushie and are just fabulous!
957	2	Although this is exactly what I had wanted however I had paid for 3 to 5 shipping and to get the item rushed, the company did not do as instructed,,,,,very disappointed.  I would not order from them again
958	4	We like the Verona Coffee. We do note the name change from Bold to Dark and will see if coffee is the same.<br />Best part is the fast regular shipping.
959	5	I also bought this product and I can tell you that I received my shipment in a timely manner and it was worth it!! This cappuccino tastes delicious with no additions like milk, cream or sugar. Just brew it by itself and enjoy the perfect combination of a great cappuccino. Absolutely worth the price and I saved a ton of $$$ by not purchasing from starbuck's..
960	5	This is a solid well made trap that works really well. Took a little tractice to get the traps positioned correctly but now they are working great. 6 gophers down so far vs one for the black tunnel kind of trap. Much easier to work with and I don't need to worry about the gophers getting spooked walking on plastic floor. Highly recommended trap and I would get at least two for your garden.
961	5	So my cafe at work switch to a bunch of chips I don't like and some Popchips.  Then they added these sweet potato chips and they're the only ones I buy now.  The sad thing is that these are hard to find at stores.  You'll find plenty of the other Popchip flavors, but not the sweet potato.  So I broke down and bought a box.  I went with the 3-ounce version because the price per oz was lower than the smaller bags.  These bags aren't TOO big, and I just use a clip on them to keep the air out after they're opened.
962	4	ASIN B000LKVT4U - A friend of mine owns an organic grocery store near me, and she's always introducing me to new foods and drinks I've never heard of - usually these introductions don't go too well.  Vruit's Orange Veggie Blend is a surprising exception.<br /><br />Falling into the newly-popular vegetable drinks that taste fruity, Vruit is a bit overpriced on the store shelves for what it is, particularly since it's not alone on that shelf.  Amazon's price is quite good, and with free shipping, you can't go wrong.  Vruit loses points from me, though, because - as an all natural product whose largest consumer base is likely to be the organic, save-the-planet crowd - it bothers me that the stuff comes in single-serving juice boxes instead of a less-packaging, more-eco-friendly recyclable bottle.<br /><br />The Orange Veggie Blend actually reminds me of an apricot juice, although a bit more tart.  There isn't exactly an after-taste, but there is an after-effect, in that my mouth feels a bit puckered and strangely dry after I drink one.  Healthy?  Yes.  Tasty?  Surprisingly, yes.  Thirst-quenching?  Not really.  A glass of cold water goes further and doesn't require me to sip from a tiny straw like a toddler.  I won't be buying these any time soon, but I'll still recommend them to others!<br /><br />- AnnaLovesBooks
963	2	Got these Kettle Chips Sea Salt & Vinegar (15 5oz bags) and was not impressed. Tasted kind of flat. I was eating some out of the bag, when I looked down into the bag and noticed a hole in the bag about the size of a sesame seed. Then I started looking at all the unopened bags and MANY of them had this type same hole. Some bags had multiple holes. One bag had a hole the size of a dime at the bottom of the bag like a rodent had got to it. The box they shipped in had NO holes so they we're packed this way. So much for quality control and who ever let these ship should be fired. Needless to say I'll never be eating anymore Kettle products and expect a full refund from Kettle or Amazon.<br />M. Martin
964	5	This is the 2nd time I have ordered these and have been pleased with the tootsie pops and the price.  They arrived promptly also.
965	5	These are given to my 2 rescue dogs at the end of the day.  They know when it is time to go out for the last time at night and sit and wait for their Greenie.  All we have to say is "do you want to brush your teeth" and they go nuts.  They love them and their teeth are in great shape...
966	5	Previously purchased larger quantity from TBFC, for my use they were good. I put them in oatmeal and use in baking, but the berries in these smaller size tubs were larger and softer better for just snacking!
967	5	My son is 16 months old and still loves these as a snack.  This is a good blend of fruit.
968	5	My family and I stumbled on this seasoning in our local grocery store. We LOVE to use it to season steak, burgers, ribs, even chicken!  The store stopped carrying it, so to Amazon I went. We highly recommend this as the best seaoning for meat!
969	5	My dog is about as picky as they come. We have the hardest time finding something that he will eat, But He ABSOLUTELY LOVES CHICKEN PURE BITES!!!<br />Every night he expects his treat! He typically doesn't bark but if you start to go to bed and Don't give him his Chicken PureBites, he will sit on the bed and look up at the container we keep them in and bark. When we get them down, he hops around like a rabbit because he is So Excited. Now, if we could only find some dog food that he LOVED this much, we would be doing Great! Snickers ABSOLUTELY LOVES THESE!!! Nothing any better as far as me and my husband are concerned!! Thanks PureBites,<br />Cea
970	5	Discovered these last week on a trip to Vermont and now I'm hooked!  They're really awesome.  They taste more like maple than coffee to me -- but whatever they are, WOW !!!! @#$%^&**&^%
971	5	If you are in the market for organic raisins, Newman's Own is a great brand. The taste is delicious, the freshness excellent, and the company has an outstanding reputation for healthy products produced under earth-friendly conditions. A further advantage Amazon offers is the chance to buy this product through Subscribe and Save.
972	1	I used to enjoy coffee from my local Caribou cafe. When I moved to a location that didnt have one I tried the Caribou blend K-cups.  Caribou blend was never my favorite, but it was all the store had at the time, so I gave it a try. The flavor is incredibly flat, one dimensional, with a bitter aftertaste, and generally unpleasant aroma (sour).  It was so off that I checked the expiration date, but found out it was still months away.  I wont buy this flavor again.
973	1	I'm extremely frustrated right now. We adopted a cat 3 weeks ago & her previous owner gave us her litter box with clay litter. After doing much research, I decided to give Feline Pine a try because it's natural. I even tried doing it gradually with her old litter as the instructions suggested, but it did not work for our cat. She wouldn't use it to poop and just didn't poop one whole night. As soon as we brought out her old litter, she used it right way. And this morning, she also tried to eat the pine pellets and then vomited! Not good. This is a great idea & I'm very disappointed that it did not work for our cat as I was very excited about this product.
974	5	I order these for my mom. She loves peach flavored drinks (juices) but was diagnosed for diabetes this year. This is a great deal for what your get. The flavor of the sugar free product is good and it gives her a great way to enjoy her peach tea. Just make sure you order from Amazon as other vendors charge 41 dollars or more for the same 4 canisters that Amazon charges 16-20 dollars for.
975	5	Just received my Mocha Esspresso click yesterday. Love it. Although the protein is lower and the carbs are higher that I like I generally just make a 1/2 serving and add a little non-fat milk and protein powder, yummmy!
976	1	Coffee was good but every cup broke during use, making a mess inside the cup and out, will not purchase again.
977	5	Delicious, especially with the sugar free vanilla creamer I use.<br />I don't know, but am sure it would be good without creamer too.
978	5	You can't go wrong with the oatmeal in a cup...I don't know why Quaker doesn't push this product harder.  I ordered a couple cases of these for my office, and my team loves them.
979	5	We love this stuff and it's hard to find locally. Great on Mexican food, especially tacos. I find it to be very hot, so I just use a little at a time.
980	5	This is great to grab at the last minute to flavor a sauce (such as brandy peppercorn) add some extra flavor to a soup.  I always keep the French demi-glace as well as the classic chicken handy in the pantry.
981	5	I'm hooked.  I add this to the bowl every time I have chips and salsa.  Can't have salsa without it.  Just a great concentration and taste compared to other extracts I've tried.  Very hot hot hot.  It was unavailable for while there but it's back!...but a little more spendy now. the dropper idea is great from the other reviewer but it would probably put the price up past 20 bucks.  I mean what manufacturer makes tiny droppers for dispensing food integrated into a cap? Maybe like Viseen eye-dropers could get some business making bottles for MAD DOG'S REVENGE habanero extract hah!  By the way don't put it in your eye or you'll prolly be blind. Just saying cuz some peeps are dumb like that. Not me I just put it in my salsa and clean my colon couple times a month oyaaaa
982	5	I tried this product at my nieces house and when I got home I had to have it. Love this stuff on chicken and make a salad
983	3	it's definetely cheaper than any grocery store, but I saw the newspaper that it has no effectiveness for diet. I was very disappointed.
984	5	I l0ve Tulsi tea! This is the very same brand I used when we lived in India, which is where it is imported from. I am SO happy to find it here in the States!! Tulsi, also known as "holy basil" is a delicious herb, related to the basil plant, but tastes more along the lines of mint. It is an antioxidant, and a powerful tea to detox, or just to relax. Plus it tastes great. No caffeine, so drink it day or night.
985	3	Which eats up a lot of storage in the pantry. Also, the powder isnt as processed and dark as I would have liked it to have been. Try fronteir cocoa powder
986	1	I've seen advertisements for 5 Hour Energy products for months now, and I finally gave in yesterday.  I purchased two 2-packs of it at my local grocery store, intent on trying one out in the morning in order to wake myself up early.  First of all, these are grossly overpriced.  At the store, a 2-pack sells for $6.  You can buy a huge coffee drink for the price of one of these little 2-ounce bottles (I don't drink coffee, but I'm just giving that as an example).  Even with the "discounts" that are offered through Amazon or the various third-party sellers, they're still overpriced.<br /><br />Now, I'll detail what happened this morning when I tried a 5 Hour Energy for the first time:<br /><br />By the time I'd gotten up the nerve to open the bottle and drink the contents, I was basically awake.  So it did, in fact, manage to wake me up, but not in the way I was expecting.  The first thing I noticed as the liquid touched my tongue was the taste.  The awful taste.  It was like a super-saturated sugar solution, only the sweet taste had been replaced with a terrible bitter sensation that has stuck with me almost two hours after consuming the drink.  So if you enjoy having a terrible taste stuck in your mouth, even after flushing your mouth out with water and even brushing your teeth, this may be the product for you.  Otherwise, steer clear.<br /><br />The second thing I noticed was that, contrary to its advertisement, it DID NOT give me an energy boost whatsoever.  I still had to drag myself out of bed like I do every day.  Even now, nearly two hours after consuming this awful liquid, I am not filled with energy.  I did, however, feel an elevated heart rate shortly after consumption, and I do feel a little jittery right now.  I'm also finding myself a little more irritable than I usually am in the mornings, and it's difficult to concentrate on even writing this review.  I think it may have even given me a stomachache.<br /><br />So, for those of you who want a bullet point summary, here you go:<br /><br />Cons<br />----<br />Awful taste that doesn't go away<br />Grossly overpriced even with the discounts that online retailers have<br />Doesn't actually give you energy<br />Possible elevated heart rate upon consumption<br />Jitters<br />Inability to concentrate<br />Might make you irritable<br />May cause stomachaches<br /><br />Pros<br />----<br />If you're tired of carrying all that money around, this could be a great way to make your wallet or purse a little lighter.<br /><br />Simply put (if you don't feel like reading the Wall of Text up above), DO NOT buy this product.  It is, by far, one of, if not THE, worst products I've ever purchased in my life.  And I've bought a lot of junk.  Don't buy into the false advertising.  Stay away.  This stuff should be banned.
987	1	Not a good deal at over two dollars a can plus shipping and these are the<br />8oz cans, not the larger 13oz cans.
988	4	fairly easy to cook, a little nutty  in (taste )for some .
989	4	This particular brand of squid ink pasta is quite delicious. Nothing beats the real thing but making this pasta is a laborious process.  Trying to find a ready made product is usually an endless search.  Finally, a brand that delivers a smooth pasta with the hint of the sea.
990	5	It was very good. I bought it to use in Blackberry Sangria. It made the drink absolutely delicious. Try it.
991	1	When I first started my 3 cats on Wellness Core, I thought it was fabulous. Suddenly their fur was shiny and bright! They liked it, too! But then reality set in... A couple of bags later, all of my cats were losing their fur in massively scary amounts. I'm not talking basic shedding, either. Their fur was falling out..everywhere. This food was causing excessive hair loss all over their bodies..on ALL my cats!!! I was really worried, because it was bad. The rep at Petco told me when I informed her of this problem that other customers had noticed the same problem in their cats. I've read other reviews, as well, where people complained about a "hairball problem" with this food. This was no ordinary "hairball" problem, let me tell you. In addition, this food is absolutely NOT for cats with weight gain tendencies. I reduced my 15 lb male cat's daily intake to WELL UNDER 1/2c of this stuff plus a TBS of canned daily, and he STILL gained weight on it! My opinion is there is some vital problem with this food that would cause such hairloss. Either there is an ingredient in it that should NOT be there, or there is something missing that SHOULD be there.<br />The Wellness regular dry w/ grains caused flakes in my cats, as well. The Wellness canned is the only thing I highly recommend from Wellness.
992	5	Gloria Jean' Butter Toffee coffee is simply the best. Rich mellow flavor is perfect anytime. All of the Gloria Jean's coffee's that I've tried are great, but this one is my all time favorite. Give it a try, you won't be sorry.
993	5	If you like to make your own hot and sour soup, cream of mushroom soup, or mushroom sauce, this is your 'shroom.  There are two things to remember:<br />1) Break or cut the 'shrooms into very small pieces.  Cooked, they are many times larger than in the dried state.<br />2) As another reviewer noted, these are best soaked thoroughly prior to cooking.<br />I wish some enterprising person in the USA would start producing these.
994	5	I found some chip I love they are good not greasey or fried baked and yummy, low in calories :-) I am not deprived and I can enjoy a healthy way of eating them. Try them you won't be disappointed!
995	5	First received a few samples from my vet.  Was so surprised to find that my finicky little girl loves these snacks.  It's nice to find something that makes her happy.  Already went through two bags and she is still loving them.
996	4	Ordered all 4 flavors, so far my favorites are the peach almond and apple walnut. The cherry pistachio is a bit sweet but still just as good. I love the fruit in it, because its real fruit not the fake kind that is in traditional fruity oatmeal. I also like its the perfect size to fill up on. The food here in Afghanistan is not up to par come breakfast time so I ordered these to help make better choices over sausage and donuts for a young woman trying to watch her health/weight. They are a bit pricey, I can only hope they are cheaper on the shelves, but once again I was just thankful they ship them to Afghanistan. Will definitely be buying more once I run low. They are absolutely delish!
997	5	This was a good deal, and the bulbs are perfect for special areas where dim lighting sets the mood.
998	1	I really wanted these to be good, but they are very bland and taste nothing like potatoes.  Actually they taste more like Rice Krispies cereal. If you want something that tastes more like a potato chip, bout low in calories, buy the Popchip.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RVAWY0">Popchips, Original, 0.8-Ounce Single Serve Bags (Pack of 24)</a>
999	5	I like that this entirely made from organic ingredients, each serving has an entire serving of fruit, and it has no added sugar.  Even the coloring comes from fruit and vegetable juice.  The best part?  It tastes wonderful!  It has a tart strawberry flavor, and the texture is great.  It's not gritty at all, like some natural fruit snacks are.  I got Clif Kid Organic Twisted Fruits to keep around for my grandchildren.  If they're lucky, I *might* still have some left when they get here!  I've definitely got to buy some more.  If I didn't already know these had no added sugar, I never would've guessed it from the taste.<br /><br />I've tried all the flavors.  They're all good, and they all have good texture, but strawberry is my favorite, probably because it tastes purer to me (only one fruit flavor, instead of two or more fruits competing for my taste buds).
1000	1	Too bad, they didn't work for me; I took 3 pills 3 to 4 times/day for about 2 weeks with no results.  In fact, they seemed to dry me up more, so I stopped using them.  I'm going to try drinking more water and eating oatmeal...
1001	5	This popcorn tastes just like at the movie theater.  Best ever that I have made at home.  Fast delivery also.
1002	3	This tea tastes more like lemonade with tea than lemon flavored tea.<br />If you like a strong lemon taste in your tea, then this is for you.  If not, then you'll be disappointed.
1003	5	I am originally from the Pittsburgh area, lived on a farm, my parents grew rhubarb. Moving to the south made it almost impossible to find rhubarb unless I actually ordered it from a grocery store. Most of the time when asking about rhubarb, nobody knew what it was. I found Barry Farm online (via Amazon)several years ago, and have ordered the pie filling eversince. My 3 boys are big fans of rhubarb pie and every Thanksgiving I make one for each of them. They look forward to those pies every year.I am thrilled at the ease it is to just pop the filling in a pie shell, add topping, and it's ready to go. Plus.....it's YUMMY !
1004	5	This is the best dip ever.  I use it as a dip with veggies and chips and also to flavor soups.  Love it! Everyone who tastes it wants to know where to buy it.
1005	5	Yummy, taste very good and is good for you. Will order many more times over. Im not much on waisting words. but thanks very much
1006	5	"DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM"... UNLESS...... you can handle the BEST tasting expresso type extra bold blend of coffee!<br /><br />This blend makes Starbucks seem like weak tea. It is definitely for serious coffee drinkers only.
1007	5	Enjoyed the value pack, the formula stretched out a bit longer than the 25 oz can.  Would purchase this product again!
1008	5	These cook so fast and are perfect everytime.  They taste great and their texture is just what it should be.
1009	5	My dog goes nuts for these!  We have our dog on "good" foods(holistic/organic) and these can't be beat!  Two ingredients:  duck and sweetpotato.  I used to buy them at Petsmart, but they haven't had them in such a long time I had to look elsewhere.
1010	5	This is my second order of the 24 pack and I'll definitely order more when I'm done with these!  All of the flavors are great, but my favorites are Honey Mustard & Onion and Jalapeno Trio. Thanks for such a wonderful snack; I'm a fan for life!!!
1011	5	I'd started to think that a good chocolate bar was a thing of the past. For the past several years, commercial chocolate bars taste more like coconut oils and chemicals than true milk chocolate. So I was delighted to taste NEWMAN'S OWN ORGANIC DARK CHOCOLATE BAR because it actually TASTES like good, rich dark chocolate. It is by far the best chocolate candy I've tasted in years. And by the way, after eating about half the bar, I needed a chocolate sauce for a family dessert. I simply melted the last half of the NEWMAN'S OWN Organic Dark Chocolate bar in the microwave until soft, and wisked in heavy cream - a small amount at a time. It created a truly decadent chocolate sauce! I will definitely be buying this chocolate again.
1012	5	I grew up with Nalley's as a kid outside of Tacoma.  The plant has moved to the midwest, so it's bittersweet to find these on Amazon.  But I've moved to the east coast.  Still, the quality of this chili is what I still remember.  I bring these along to simmer when we go camping.  The flavor is still great, and the prime shipping and cost is a great value.
1013	5	K-Cups are great if you only drink one cup a day otherwise it could get expensive.  This flavor is good for the basic coffee drinker, no funky flavors added, just basic coffee.
1014	5	My husband and I loved these crackers. They had a nice crunchy texture, a delicious nutty flavor from the sesame seeds and not too salty. Originally we purchased them because we like to try new crackers, but they quickly became our favorite. I enjoyed them with hummus also. We don't have a problem with gluten, we just liked the cracker. I would definitely recommend them to people.
1015	1	Be warned. The third ingredient is potato, which is very starchy and nearly as bad as wheat or corn for some cats. My cat developed IBD after eating this product and almost died. I have switched him to Evo canned but even the Evo dry is a better product than this food.
1016	1	Rhonda and Meredith are 100% correct. We have eaten dozens of these cookies and loved, loved, loved them. They were missing from local stores for a few months. Finally they reappeared so I grabbed a box. YIKES. In my email to Late July I said the new cookies tasted like "burned chemicals and vomited chocolate". And isn't it interesting, I've had no reply from Late July. Very sad. What was once delicious and dependable is now, for mysterious reasons, the worst cookie/burned chemical vomit ever created. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
1017	1	Only good use for these would be: In case of poisoning, use to induce vomiting!
1018	4	Nice alternative.  Very lightly carbonated.  I'd say if a normal carbonated drink ranges from 80 to 100 on the fizzy scale, this one's about an 11.<br /><br />At 26 grams, it's still a lot of sugar (mostly from apple and grape juice, I think).  I'll order a case just 'cuz I thought it was good and I'm calling it 4 stars - but honestly, I'd rather have it 50% splenda or stevia sweetened.
1019	4	Bought it for my husband as a gift.  he liked it but not as much as Tony Roma;s, and many others.  We wont be buying these again.
1020	4	The hot chocolate was good. It does taste a little powdery if you put too much of the powder in it. Can't beat made from scratch but it's better than the other hot chocolate powder I have try.
1021	4	For the last 15+ years, Figis.com has provided our family with what I've always thought was the best summer sausage available today.<br /><br />This Christmas, I was given a 20 ounce package of Old Wisconsin Original Summer Garlic Sausage. Without even opening it, I already made up my mind that if it's not a Figis product, it won't measure up.<br /><br />Boy was I wrong! I can't believe the quality of this summer sausage. The taste is one that cannot be described, you'll just have to try it yourself.<br /><br />Off to order more...
1022	5	This product was recommened to us from a friend.  After doing some research I found out that it was one of the best ceral's out there and recommended by Dr. Sears.  After buying some at a local store and trying it my baby LOVVVED it!  I could not fee him fast enough! The pre & probiotics really help him not get "backed" up.  I also save so much with the subscribe and save.  Thanks amazon and thank you happy bellies!!
1023	5	Hands down most delicious tea I have ever had. In fact it tastes so decadent it doesn't even taste like tea. With a little stevia and almond milk I feel like I'm drinking a delicious dessert! (Although I only drink it in the morning/ before 3pm since it does back quite a caffeinated kick!
1024	5	If you cannot tolerate extremely hot spicy chips, but like some zing with the crunch then these chips are made for your enjoyment. I purchased these around the holidays and they were truly enjoyed by many guests. Yes, I will be purchasing these chips again because they are really good for you being organic, and affordable.
1025	4	I have been a coffee drinker for over 70 years(My grampa started me off, sipping from his cup, as a babe on his knee).<br />I never thought I would give up coffee, but this has been a seamless transition.  I must admit, I add 1/3rd ground columbian and it makes a delightfuly smoothe, nonacidity tasting brew.  I think straight coffee has lost me forever.<br />  Gloria
1026	5	My cats are just nuts about this food.  I transitioned them (one is 10 and the other is almost 12) to Evolution about 4 years ago with some trepidation. I read _The Obligate Carnivore_ and being vegan myself was persuaded to give vegan cat food a try. At the time my oldest kitty, Daisy, was on prescription cat food (Science Diet, I think) that I could only purchase from the vet--she had a history of urinary tract infections. Even while eating the prescription food she would occasionally have flair ups. Since she's been eating Evolution she has not had even one flair up. In fact, she's practically abusive about having a full bowl at all times. Even her vet (who doesn't know that Daisy's food is vegan) is astonished at how youthful she appears and acts. That's all the evidence I needed to feed my girls an animal free diet.
1027	5	Coffee milk was a beloved treat from my New England childhood and for I long time I would search for the coffee syrup in the area where I moved, the Deep South. I did a cursory search on Amazon for coffee, syrup to be delight not only to find it, but to find the brand we actually used. Somethings you try as an adult for nostalga, end up not tasting quite as good as you remember from your childhood; not the case here. This is as good as I remember and I'm very pleased to have this treat back in my life!<br /><br />I have my coffee milk back, but the versitality of this syrup is endless, I've used it to make mocha cookies and coffee cake (not in just name, but taste.) Thank you!!
1028	4	I hadn't had coffee in over 20 months and only needed a small excuse to start again.  The new Keurig Coffee Maker and the Cafe Mocha provided the motive.  The Mocha is rich and tasty.  Very nice on cold winter mornings.  My wife loves them as well.  Great combination...
1029	5	We use to purchase Garlic Expressions Vinaigrette at our local grocery store but for some reason they are no longer carrying it.  It is the only salad dressing my family will use!  we love the clean taste and use it on everything!
1030	5	This coffee has a wonderfully rich flavor.  My husband, who brews his coffee quite strong, was pleased with the flavor.  His comment was, "Just like they make in Germany!". From him, that is the best compliment this coffee could get.
1031	5	Our little girl is 9 years old now. A year ago she was so ill, she would vomit up a lot of yellow mucus<br />and she would shiver & shake most all the time and she became so recluse & go hide under the bed and<br />stay there most all the time.<br />She use to play all the time, she has about 10-12 toys and we named them all<br />when we got home & we would always tell her go get, fish, frannie, bob, tye, and the list goes on and she would bring them to us. Well she even stopped playing.<br />Well I got on the internet and read for hours the reviews on Dr. Harveys dog food and I ordered it last Set 2010<br />and I kid you not, with in a day we had our little girl back again no more throwing up no more shaking.<br />We are retired and she wear's us out wanting to<br />play all the time.<br />I thank our Good Lord for this wonderful dog food.<br />I do not work for Dr. Harvey's and this is writtem by me personally. If you dog or dog's are sick (PLEASE PLEASE)<br />try this food.<br />I buy 5LB and it makes 33LB's of dog food. Do the math it is cheaper then buying the dry dog food with<br />all the chemicals in it and just end up throwing it out because your dog only eats it, because he/she is really hungry.<br />And you save money running to the Vet's because your dog is sick all the time.<br />I did not know Amazon carried this food until I checked it tonight. I have just ordered it tonight from Amazon.<br />I do a lot of shopping here & I love the service Amazon offers to us buyers.<br />Good luck everyone with your little babies.
1032	5	I used to ration this item cause the supermarkets here do not sell this item. Anyway, I ordered this item and now I have an abundent supply of cool brew tea. It's great tasting and easy to make.<br /><br />This is a good buy.
1033	1	I opened the first jar and you could pour this peanut butter.  While I expect some oil on the top, this had broken down to a liquid consistency.  The expiration date is 3/12 so maybe it sat in a hot warehouse? Wish I had not purchased 24 jars but have never seen anything like this before.
1034	5	This is a great product to cook with, but I wouldn't recommend it for acid indigestion.  I would recommend Bob's other baking soda for acid indigestion, heart burn and it's great for changing your body's pH. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004VLV2V0">Bob's Red Mill Baking Soda, 16-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>
1035	5	I've had this bottle, unopened in my refrigerator for quite sometime and finally gave it chance. WOW!!! Taste, Aroma, and Pungency were amazing.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.
1036	5	This tea lives up to its claims;  it really works!  Tastes good too!
1037	5	This Agave Nectar is great.  I use it to sweeten my tea and other beverages.
1038	5	It came in a timely fashion & it was a good price for the quantity I received. This tea is good for occasional constipation or to help your body along when it feels irregular.
1039	5	This is a fantastic idea and the ONLY solution for storage of K-cups without taking up valuable counter or drawer space. An excellent good quality product that works as advertised - thank you for creating it!! P.S. I used the 4 screws for added security and they installed without the use of a drill!
1040	5	These Creme Filled Wafer bars taste absolutely amazing!!!  They do not have any of the chalky taste of most high protein bars and it is very light and crispy, compared to any other bar on the market. I have a very busy lifestyle with work, the gym, surfing, mountain biking, etc, so bars and protein drinks are a staple.  I have tried many bars and this one is my favorite.  I used to love zone bars because they were crispy and not as "Dense" as most protein bars, but then I discovered these bars and I will never go back.  These bars are the perfect snack when you need protein fast. I take no xplode before I workout so I can't eat anything 2 hours prior to my workout. My workout are usually 1 to 2 hours long and not eating for 4 hours can really put a strain on your goals of bulking up.  I take a power crunch bar with me to the gym and eat it during my workout. Its light enough where it doesn't reduce the pump I get from the no xplode and it's just enough to get the protein you need to build muscle.
1041	5	This was absolutely great stuff.  It was fresh and delicious. It received my item in a couple of days just as they said.  I would definitely use these guys again.
1042	1	tried wellness webb bars, whitefish and sweetpotatoes and with crunchy peanuts and honey.  have three dogs two just push them away, the third who will eat dirt inhaled them.  Rate this products as a 0.
1043	5	I was skeptical going in- two tablespoons for 45 calories while regular peanut butter was 180? Yeah, right.<br /><br />So it may be a bit spendy and you DO have to mix it yourself. Small price to pay! Tastes even better than regular peanut butter and I can eat it daily, getting the nutrients of peanuts without the fat and extra calories!!<br /><br />A month later, and I'm almost done with the bag. I'll DEFINITELY be purchasing again.
1044	4	The only real downside is that you have to plan ahead.  It has to cook for about 30 min. Its has a harty texture, it does not taste anything like the typical oatmeal that I have found in stores., really good. I eat this oatmeal almost every morning for my breakfast. This is the BEST Oatmeal I ever Tried. Absolutely yummy. I cook my oatmeal according to the direction, listed on the can, You make it with 4 cups of water, bring to a boil and 1 cup of oatmeal. When I added the oatmeal to the boiling water, you stir, let get a bit  thick, than I place a lid on the pot of oatmeal to steam it for a while longer.
1045	3	I'm a black tea lover, I usually brew leaf teas. I like Darjeeling and Ceylon teas and I'm not much of an Assam fan, but can like it in moderation. That said, I don't understand the fascination with Tazo teas. I've tried some of their bagged green teas and they were too flavored and one could hardly taste the "green" part of the tea. This black tea on the other hand is so strong that if properly brewed it completely kills my taste buds. Sometimes one wants bagged teas to quickly make oneself a cup, but not at such taste disadvantage. I ended up babysitting these tea bags and pulling them out early, but it's not quite it and the convenience factor is out of the window. This tea is understandably still an upgrade on Lipton and Tetley bagged black teas.
1046	4	Package arrived very quickly and well protected. The only issue I had was that 3 of the chocolate cups arrived mis-shaped. However, I set them in the window for a very short time, and they softened just enough to be moldable. I also think that there was no way to prevent it since the heat wave temperatures were so high the week they were in shipment. I would not have paid for any "overnight" expensive delivery no matter what and any kind of "thermal" packaging would make them too expensive. I recommend these to anyone and will order again.
1047	5	As far as boxed products go, this is by far the best.  There is no substitute and no imitation.  If you follow the directions (including the butter), you can't go wrong.  I have found that the sauce can get lumpy if not done right so it seems to work best if made in a separate sauce pan and added later.  Of course, it may say that on the box, but I've never looked.  This is just trial and error here.  Much better than Kraft mac n cheese though only this variety.  The other Annie's don't compare.
1048	4	I'm a grind-my-own kind of guy, and I'm not much for flavored coffees, but I have to admit that this is very nice, and if you have it with the right food (like a nice piece of pie), the vanilla adds a little something extra to the experience.<br /><br />But the bag it came in...GRR!<br /><br />It's apparent that Melitta is trying to ensure freshness with the double-seal they used, but after trying for about 5 minutes and managing only to tear the foil above the seal, I gave up and cut the bag with scissors.<br /><br />In other words, you'll need a canister if you want it to keep this coffee fresh, because, unless you have more luck than I did opening the package, storing it in the bag is not an option.
1049	5	1. 150 calories<br /><br />2. low in fat<br /><br />3. high in fiber<br /><br />4. high in protein<br /><br />5. NO high fructose corn syrup<br /><br />6. NO partially-hydrogenated soybeen oil<br /><br />7. NO aspartame, saccharin, or sucralose<br /><br />8. LOADS of vitamins and minerals<br /><br />9. pleasantly sweet and chocolatey<br /><br />10. KASHI!
1050	5	I felt compelled to write a review here for 2 reasons.<br /><br />#1  This is seriously, without a doubt, the best instant cappuccino I've ever had (and, perhaps, best cappuccino, PERIOD).  Originally purchased in canister format, the single serve packets are even better, as it offers just the perfect amount for each serving, and you can take it w/ you on the go.<br /><br />#2  The one and only review here is not indicative, informative, helpful nor is it relevant to the actual product for sale!<br /><br />I've given out packets to friends and co-workers.  All have come back w/ ecstatic responses.  I highly recommended this product.  You will not be disappointed!
1051	2	Our 13 year old Golden lab wants nothing to do with this food.  He smells it, took a bite then started barking at his bowl.  He finally quit when I took the bowl away and gave him Kibbles n' bits (his favorite).  I donated the bag to a local shelter, hopefully they can use it.
1052	5	I was thoroughly surprised how good these brownies are.  I added nuts which my family loves and melted chocolate chips on top.  They are moist and a little chewy (again which my family loves). I love the fact that they use brown rice flour, red beet sugar and non-aluminum baking powder. And if you compare these brownies to other brands, they are lower in sugar. They are a big hit with family and friends.
1053	5	I love this product from Quaker and I'm certainly not a fan of grits. These, however, are really delicious just with salt, pepper and butter or margarine. The small ham bits taste authentic and add a quite different taste and consistency to normally bland grits. They're instant so it only takes a minute or two to prepare and they go well as a side dish with eggs and biscuits or toast, or just served alone. I like the small individual packets, especially, as I can even take them to work. Ordering them in bulk from Amazon is even better as I always know I have plenty on hand as these are the only grits I eat.
1054	4	I won't comment on the price because that can change. We all do our best to find deals and bargains.<br /><br />This food is wonderful. I used to buy cheap, grocery store stuff and tried this on a whim. I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />My dog is a little older and is missing some teeth. Since he is a shih tzu he also throws up from time to time after eating. (Do all shih tzus do this, mine has since birth) Anyway, this food seems to cut down on the incidents. The pieces are very small and easy for him to chew.<br /><br />It's good for him, a great size for my little dog, and I will continue to buy it.
1055	5	The Ranch flavored Cornnuts are the best flavor offered!  Everyone in our house, as well as other friends, agree that these are a winner.  The Ranch taste is right on mark and he perfect balance of seasonings and saltiness.
1056	4	I haven't given up, but my cats don't seem to like this.  I gave it four stars because I'm a big fan of the Wellness line of foods, and this product is very solid in terms of nutrition.  The bag is resealable, and there's no rational reason my cats have turned their noses up at it.
1057	5	I am a long time customer of Amazon.com and everytime I try to order this bread mix it comes up they will not ship to Canada. Amazon in Canada does not carry food items.<br />Please allow us to order too<br />Mrs Huyben/ Ontario Canada
1058	5	My dog loves these! They're the best chewie he has. Perfect for car trips in his crate.
1059	4	Im not sold on using this as a peanut butter substitute (like for PBJ sandwich or dipping crackers or celery), but it is rock solid for recipes.  I like that I can get full blown peanut butter flavor in recipes (cookies, smoothies, cakes, pie, pancakes, ice cream, etc.) without the 200 calories of actual peanut butter.  The PB2 website has hundreds of recipes to use this with.  I check their site all the time for fun uses of PB2.<br /><br />As for making actual peanut butter (e.g. mixing the powder with water), I did not like it and wont use it for that.
1060	4	Jack Link's beef jerky is a quick and great tasting way to get extra protein into your diet.  A great snack.  I really like the teriyaki flavor.
1061	2	I purchased this product as an alternative to a rawhide. Our 5 month old German Shorthair Pointer puppy ate it in a matter of 6 minutes or less. She loved it, but it was more of an expensive treat.<br /><br />With a puppy, I needed something to satisfy her chewing urge. The treat fractured into small bits all over the floor but our dog was willing to pick those up. The pieces looked rather sharp and that was a concern. Others mentioned it was made in China and I would like to add the first ingredient is corn.  It might last longer for very small dogs.
1062	3	I have bought cases and cases of this stuff over the years.  I am really shocked at how watered-down this product has become.  I thought it was me just getting used to it, but it is not.  I have become very frustrated with Torani's tampering with and reformulating their syrups.  Even compared to their "sugar-ful" syrup, I find that I have to use almost twice as much of this product.  I have found a similar story with other Torani Sugar-Free syrups.  It seems they are making up for the trivial cost of the artificial sweetener and giving you less.<br /><br />As a result, I have been trying many other sugar-free (and sugar-ful) syrups -- and spending a lot, too.  In comparison, Monin O'Free chocolate syrup is roughly 2X as flavorful/concentrated, but sadly, it is about 2X as much cost.  Plus, you may have to pay S/H.  While the Torani flavor is pretty good (slight chemical taste), the Monin is a bit malty, so I would give the Torani the edge.  I have also tried DaVinci's sugar-free chocolate syrup.  It probably has the best taste, but like Torani, it is watered down.  DaVinci's is a bit more on the bittersweet side.  At twice the cost, however, it is hard to justify when a bottle only lasts about a week (> $1 per big mug of coffee).<br /><br />Hopefully, others can post what good sugar-free syrups they find.  I hope my review and comparison was helpful.
1063	5	I use a hand-cranked roller mill to make rolled oats, and eat these oats uncooked with skim milk for breakfast.  A breakfast cereal with NO ADDED SUGAR!  Also, because it's "heavy," I tend to eat less than with sugared cereals.<br /><br />Package indicates 110 calories and 2.5 grams fat (3% of an adult's suggested daily intake) per 1/4 cup, but I eat about twice this amount (1/2 cup), so it's not really a completely low calorie meal.  But it does "stick to the stomach," and one feels fuller after eating it, perhaps not eating as much at the next meal.  The cost works out to a little more than $2/pound, which isn't inexpensive, but I'm sure that this four-pack, totaling 7-plus pounds, will keep the average family in oat groats for awhile!  Also, it contains an immense amount of fiber -- 17% of the recommended daily amount per 1/4 cup, or about 34% per 1/2 cup the way I prepare it.  So if you need fiber, this is it!<br /><br />I highly recommend this method of preparation (using a roller mill, no cooking).  The taste is nutty, filling.  It takes less than 30 seconds to put 1/2 cup through a roller mill.  I recommend that you don't add sugar.<br /><br />I ordered another brand of oat groats that had an unpleasant taste; these oats taste simply like oats.<br /><br />I ordered the product via Amazon Prime on a Friday afternoon, and Amazon delivered it the next day, Saturday!!  Amazing, Amazon!!!
1064	1	Save your money. This cheesoning has Way To Much Salt. It ruin's the flavor. Will not buy again. zero stars.
1065	5	This is the best Thai brown Jasmine rice either my wife, who is Thai, or myself, who lived in Thailand for three years, have ever eaten. This includes our time in Thailand.
1066	4	I used to eat these noodles in high school in the UK and absolutely loved them. The girls from Hong Kong sold them. Yes, they are big in Hong Kong, but the maker themselves, Nissin is Japanese.<br /><br />Other reviewers are right, it is a knock off of the famous Ramen noodles. However, for me, these noodles taste differently than Ramen.<br /><br />When I buy Ramen in the US, I absolutely do not like it. These ones, I do like. To me it is an alternative and better version of Ramen. The only complaint I have is that the soup base powder is slightly too salty. But that can be fixed by reducing the quantity added.<br /><br />To add that spice, it goes well with Chinese chilli oil
1067	5	The sauce I ordered made it to my doorstep very quickly. Additionally, it arrived in perfect condition just as it was described online. Overall, I am very pleased with my experience and would definitely purchase this item again.
1068	4	Pretty sure these are the only puffs that happy baby makes that are gluten free. For a baby with an allergy, these have been perfect. My one year old still eats them because she has no teeth.<br /><br />They do go stale in the container if your baby doesn't finished them in a few days.
1069	1	The expiration date says Oct 2013, but smells like rancid oil upon opening.  This is the SECOND container I have purchased from two different stores (the first one ALSO smelled horrible and I threw it out).  This tells me if it is a bad batch, it must be a HUGE bad batch.  I am going to look for another cereal for my baby.
1070	5	Maybe it has changed, but it's exactly as the Amazon.com description I  read. It's Montreal Smoked Meat, presliced and in packets. It's not pastrami. If you want pastrami, buy pastrami. It's Montreal Smoked Meat and perfect as such.
1071	5	These are super treats! My dog would open them herself-if she had thumbs. Now to the price-$6.99 for 4 ounces...when I read that I did a double take. Say what!!!! I buy these at my local grocery store for $1.79 per 4 ounce bag. People please shop around - this price is outrageous - unless, of course, there is a gold nugget at the bottom of the bag.
1072	1	I usually love Yogi products but this one is TERRIBLE!!  It is so bitter I cannot even drink it.  The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009F3SAA">Yogi Chai Black, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a> version is much better.  If you still want green tea, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001A47SIW">AriZona Mandarin Orange Green Tea with Ginseng & Honey Jasmine, 20 Count Tea Bags, 1.55-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>is very good.
1073	5	I want to avoid sugar intake as much as possible.  I have friends who come by who are diabetic and I don't need the calories.  I got this and really love the taste.<br /><br />It's not got the sort of salty or bitter after taste type of flavor some of them do.  It's also not as caustic as Mountain Dew or Pepsi Max is, at least to my pallet.  Just a clean flavor, but not as light as flavored water.  No caffeine is a plus as well.  Yummy.
1074	5	I feel kinda nasty using this since it's Taco Bell and fast food is gross, but this stuff tastes good! When you use it in lean beef it tastes just like Taco Bell, only it's actually made out of beef instead of what they use, LOL. I would recommend this stuff for sure.
1075	5	Very good seasoning for anything I've grilled. Last night, I pitted it against a well-known brand of BBQ seasonings (the ones with the round black cap) on some pork chops. The Goya Adobo chops were favored over the other brand by everyone at the table.<br /><br />I'll definitely buy again.
1076	5	I bought Tart Is Smart Tart Cherry Concentrate 32 ounce bottle.  It has only been 3 days and I can already feel a difference. I take 2 Tablespoons a day swirled into a cup of nonfat vanilla yogurt for a healthy, delicious cherry sundae dessert.  I am a registered dietitian and I am very impressed with the research on the benefits of tart cherry juice.
1077	4	These are really good, but whoa! there's no missing the pepper. Forget the kids' lunchbox, save these for yourself, and keep a glass of water nearby.
1078	5	this bars are the best thing in the world<br />I love sweet food, and this bars are the thing that I needed.<br />the flavor is excellent and it has only 100 calories, that is better
1079	5	This is hands down the best k cup out there. Great flavor, strong but not bitter, good bodied cup o joe. coffee people seem to have the best k cups out there. I do enjoy Newman's own special dark roast, but this black tiger is the best. Jet fuel is very similar, but not as good as this one>
1080	5	This is the 2nd Easter that we have used these Casings for our homemade Kielbasa with great success.  We will most likely reorder again for next Easter.
1081	5	This is the BEST Salsa on the market! Bar none! Just the way we like it. NOT for the faint of heart! Thank you for the excellent product. Keep up the good work!
1082	5	Excellent dill for pickling.  Wonderful smell, fresh, with a good sealed package.  Shipped quick too. What more can I say about a couple pounds of dill? Seemed clean without stems etc.
1083	5	My dogs just about freeze in place when I pull the bag out they are so focused on that bag! Great quality and sizing is pretty uniform.<br /><br />Order the 20 pack for best pricing, the 24 pack is more per ear.  I do not understand...
1084	4	I would have given it a five star if it had arrived in gift packaging.  Not that the packaging is necessary, but in my book if you make a promise in an advertisement you should follow through.  However the lack of any packaging besides a regular priority mail box did not harm the product.  What I received was a great selection of coffees, no repeats, lots of flavors, different blends and roasts.  All in all a great product!
1085	5	I love this coffee with cream and sugar-free caramel syrup (with Splenda).  It has a smooth taste...perfect for my morning coffee.
1086	5	I did not buy this tea through amazon.. But from my grandmothers cabinet(haha). I have been dieting for the past 3 months now, and i was completely oblivious to special teas for cleansing although i know of drinks/pills that cleanse, I wanted to steer clear of any type of pill and again oblivious to benefits of cleansing(even when not dieting). Now I tried this tea two months ago & only because of the words "Super Dieters" I thought ohh special tea so i drank it(in the evening) it did for me do its job and loosen things up which i found odd at first then i read the package, and then I got it. So for me it did help being that I usually dont um go as much as I should and this has helped that. Not only that but since I have been using it along with my eatting habits, and exercise my diet has been showing better results nothing drastic but still better results and that is always great! This tea (Cinnamon Spice) I think tastes devine, I do add not even a teaspoon of sugar but I think this tea doesn't even need sugar at all(i just like it sweeter). But all in all I do and have recommended this tea to a few family members and friends(who do and dont diet) because i love the taste and the results I'm having with it.
1087	1	There are so many artificial ingredients in this it made me ill to read it.  If you can smell the bourbon (which is just above the salt) then you have a better nose than my hound.  If you want sodium benzoate, yellow #5, yellow #6, red #40, blue #1, partially hydrogenated soybean oil, diglycerides, artifical flavor and sodium propionate, this is your fruitcake.  I wish I could send you mine.  The flavor was very disappointing but what can you expect with all those chemical.  They need to let the nuns make the cake.  I think the monestary part is just a ploy.
1088	5	I have been cooking for my dog since before the pet food scare, that gets to be too much at times when you have other things to do or aren't feeling well, I have been feeding the dry Newmans for 3 years but have a spoiled cocker who has to have a little 'something' in with her dry.....this canned food drives her crazy, she just loves it, must be the whitefish in. She gets a teaspoon or so in with her dry & cleans the bowl...Amazons price beats that big box store when you use subscribe & save.
1089	5	I have been using both the blonde and regular for about a week now and really like the product.  I especially love this in my coffee.  It dissolves quickly and as mentioned in a previous post, you don't need to use as much as you do with refined sugar.  Feels good to be ingesting something tasty that isn't bad for my body!
1090	5	This stuff is FANTASTIC.  Throw salmon in skillet, sprinkle some of this on, and voila!  Most delicious home-cooked salmon you'll ever have, no sauce necessary.
1091	5	I bought a box of this and was rather skeptical about it--boy was I wrong.  I have made awesome fried chicken and onion rings using this coating.  Hubby doesn't have to eat GF but even he said they were some of the best onion rings he'd ever had.  To give it a little more "kick" I add a little bit of garlic powder and seasoned salt, and soak the chicken or onions in buttermilk, and once in a while put a little bit of hot sauce in the buttermilk.  This was definitely a worthwhile purchase for me.
1092	3	These candies were good. I'm not saying they weren't sweet. But they didn't give me any energy that I noticed. I enjoyed them, but can't say I'd go out of my way to buy any on my own, and it certainly wouldn't occur to me to recommend them to a friend. Relatively mediocre.
1093	4	Some of these "healthy" snack products taste like the box they come in.  "SoyJoy" comes to mind.  Ick.<br /><br />However, Pamela's gluten-free oat chocolate chip coconut "bars" are quite tasty and satisfying.  The cover of the box lists it as wheat-free, gluten-free, non-dairy, with 180 mg of Omega-3 fatty acids, 9 grams of whole grains, and no trans fat.  In small print on the side we also find that this company donates to celiac sprue and autism organizations.<br /><br />And it is indeed, as the box also claims, "moist and chewy."  The major downer about the product is merely its consistency, as it comes out of its packet as some kind of misshapen, ill-defined lump rather than a literal "bar," and as such it doesn't hold together very well, but that's nitpicking.  Just eat it while it's still in the wrapper and there's no mess.<br /><br />Ingredients include gluten-free oats, rice flour, organic chocolate chunks, coconut sugar, organic eggs, & almonds.  Well worth a try if this description appeals to you.  Enjoy!
1094	4	I bought this popcorn to use with the Whirley Popper (a highly recommended purchase) I purchased on Amazon.  This popcorn is great-tasting with an ever-so-slight hint of coconut ... yes that is the extra something you taste in movie-theater corn! It's better than the popcorn from Wabash Valley Farms (the brand that comes with the Whirley Popper), in my opinion.  It tastes just like the kind you get at the movie theater or a carnival and the smell is just fantastic.  When using my WhirleyPop I usually only get about 10-12 unpopped kernels.  The more comfortable I get using the popper I'm sure that number will decrease.  The corn pops up nice and crispy without any greasiness (as sometimes movie theater popcorn can be).<br /><br />However, I do think that the popcorn is a bit too salty (thus giving it 4 stars instead of 5) for my family's taste so I use only 1/2 - 3/4 of the seasoning versus using the entire packet.<br /><br />I think I got a great deal being that I recieved the popcorn, oil, and seasoning all for $39.99 and free shipping.  It couldn't be easier because all I do is dump it all in the popper and 'turn the crank!<br /><br />A minor complaint I do have, and I'm wondering if this has happened to anyone else, is that a few of the packets do leak a little bit; nothing major but enough to notice.  I will continue to purchase this brand because of the great taste and ease of use!<br /><br />UPDATE***In retrospect $39.99 wasn't that great of a deal being that now, the price has gone down by $10+!  :o)  I have been using my popper with this popcorn for quite some time now and rarely get any more than 5-10 unpopped kernels.  I have tried other brands as well, buying bulk popcorn kernels with Orvil Reddenbocker's popcorn oil and they do not even compare.  I did it to try and save a bit more money and not only did my popcorn not come out to my liking, it was quite a pain measuring the ingredients.  I will be sticking to Great American!
1095	1	Used to eat the Spicy Thai flavor all the time.  MSG makes my body unhappy and this was one of the few flavored chips that was MSG free.  Now they have changed the whole recipe and how they make them.  Instead of being real food on the ingredients like it used to be its mostly processed chemical garbage, a bunch more salt and MSG stuffed in under the label "yeast extract".  They removed the NO MSG from the label so they know very well what they did.<br /><br />The worst part though is that they taste horrible.  Instead of crisp, oily and full of character...say as if they were cooked in like...a kettle or something they instead have the color and uniformity of baked lays.  The Spicy Thai flavor now tastes like sour cream and onion or ranch that has gone rancid.<br /><br />What a shame, no more kettle chips for me.  It seems they are slowly moving one flavor at a time to this new cheap ingredient list and manufacturing method.  Dont be fooled into paying a premium price for these chips as they are not a premium product anymore.
1096	4	I must say these brownies are good! They may be "diet brownies" but they don't taste like them! I have to say though the price is a little bit mich for only 24 small packs of brownies.
1097	4	I notice from the labels that the net weight of this is actually lower than the net weight for their organic white tea. This implies somewhat less tea proper per bag, since the mint is also part of the weight. If drinking white tea for the health benefits, this may be important. It would be nice if it was easy to determine the exact amount of tea being bought.
1098	4	Great tasting coffee. Exactly the flavor it says. Not too much flavor, but perfect. Great dessert coffee. Very pleased and will purchase again!
1099	5	tried several brands of dried tart ("sour") cherries, but the preservation process always added sugar to the point of candy-sweetness.  These are actually sour; terrific for baking (which is why I ordered them)& ADDICTIVE tangy snacking.  Yes, a large quantity, but they stay soft in airtight containers, in cool or cold storage.  EXCELLENT VALUE.
1100	4	The product was fine, but the cost of shipping was more than the cost<br />of the tea.  Won't make that mistake again.
1101	1	Dabur Amla Hair Oil 300ml<br />I do NOT recommend this product at all.  It smells AWFUL and I didn't notice any difference in the feeling or behavior of my hair after leaving it on overnight and then conditioning the next day.  I'm not even sure that it's all that authentic because the ingredients on the bottle don't list any that are compelling.<br />Since trying this item, I have switched to Extra Virgin Olive Oil from my kitchen cabinet, used the same protocol for treating my hair and have noticed a softer quality in my hair as a result.<br />Don't waste the time or money ordering this product.  Go to an Indian market and choose from more authentic products.
1102	3	Ok but not as good tasting or as sweetening for me as the NuNaturals stevia - my favorite being the NuNaturals Nustevia Pure White Stevia Extract.<br />The main ingredient is Organic Agave Inulin. I usually avoid agave ( and fructose) as it has to metabolize in the liver.<br />It took 4 packets to sweeten a glass of light lemonade to my taste, twice as many as some other sweetners.
1103	5	It looks good in the box not sure how it works my man is to LAZY to put it up SOooooooo it looks like I am going to have to get moody for it to be installed.... Men ... Can't live with them and it is against the law to shoot them.
1104	5	I bought these because im stationed in Japan and I just love honey combs, well i recieved them in the mail and sat down in front of the tv with my bowl and spoon. Ice cold lactaid milk and poured me a bowl and i must say they were FRESH. I thought getting cereal in the mail would come stale and then get them all the way to Japan would make matters worse well it didnt i love my HoneyCombs.
1105	1	Flowers arrived limp and dead. I had ordered Roses, but they sent me something else. I don't know what they are, because they are mostly dead. The first impression is the one that counts. The recipient was very disappointed and thought it was done on purpose to piss her off. No replacement flowers, refund, or resending the correct ones will undo the damage. Thanks ProFlowers.<br /><br />First I only complained (did not ask for a refund out right) because I had one more day fordelivery. "Mike" assured me I would get them the following day in the morning, so I waited. I did not receive the order by 10AM so I called. They had no record of a replacement order and said they have over 200 employees with many "Mikes". When I requested same day delivery (because of my problem), they said they could not deliver the same day, even though they offer this service online. So now it is Friday and mother's day is on Sunday. I don't have any Roses with a refund that means nothing.<br /><br />STAY AWAY FROM THESE GUYS. I also have experience with 1800flowers, but they also made mistakes sending the wrong/dead flowers. To be fair, they only screwed up 1 time out of 7 orders. But that one time was enough for me to look like a cheap fool and go to ProFlowers, and now this! Walk to your local florist and have them deliver the old fashion way.
1106	5	If you've received that mostly cake-like substance that is passed off for "fruitcake" & are totally convinced you don't like fruitcake at all, then you've clearly never had Claxton fruitcake.<br /><br />I would likely never have tried this, except my brothers sold this as a fund-raiser when we were kids.<br /><br />This is more like compressed dried fruit with a tiny bit of cake here & there to hold it together.<br /><br />If you like sweet dried fruit w/ pecans, you'll likely love this stuff!<br /><br />Our family has had this stuff for roughly 40 years & we still love it!
1107	5	My husband and I are fans of dark, strong, black coffee...but hate bitter coffee (which dark, black and strong does not have to be).  Timothy's Midnight Magic is terrific.  We still have small issues with the K-Cups because they are obviously not ground and brewed from scratch.  But my husband loves the convenience and fun of brewing different tastes during the day (he works at home) without the fuss.  Timothy's blends are excellent.  We generally use the mid-level strength on our machine and found that works best for good flavor...
1108	5	I prefer white popcorn to yellow, and it's getting impossible to find white popcorn in the grocery stores around here, so I ordered this because the price is good. It pops well and tastes good. Of course, I don't actually know of any popcorn that DOESN'T pop well and taste good, unless I screw up the process. In case you're wondering about ordering this much popcorn all at once: I looked it up, and most sources say you can store unpopped popcorn for up to two years before it starts to lose moisture. You'll have to transfer this to something airtight, though; it comes in plastic bags closed with twist ties.
1109	1	I bought the 2-pack of this product as I love to use garlic but hate peeling the stuff, so I use garlic powder extensively in my cooking. I bought this product thinking, wow this will last a long time and since it's Durkee it must be good !<br /><br />This product is so salty that it ruined a whole pot of all-beef chili that I just made which is a terrible waste of time and money.<br /><br />I have used garlic powder for years and because I need to restrict my salt intake, I have avoided garlic salt for those same years which is easy to do when the product is properly marked.<br /><br />Since lots of people like garlic salt, I don't know why Durkee didn't just market this product as garlic salt which trust me, it is.  And salty garlic salt at that.<br /><br />If you're a garlic lover like me, avoid this product like the plague.
1110	5	I'm a true fan of Coconut!!! This product is great!! Smells awesome!!! What I love about it so much is, u can cook with it, use as a moisurizer for both ur body and hair, and a daily supplement!!! You definitely get your money's worth!!!
1111	5	Only problem is that I don't know how to make them last longer. But that is not entirely a problem, eh?
1112	4	Well the product was good and the taste is great. The convenience was excellent and the delivery was quick. So what's not to love? The darn things tend to clog up my machine. Never ever happens with coffee. May one could run hot water after each serving to prevent the clog. Otherwise an excellent product.
1113	5	This is an excellent product for those who wish to protect their plants from fungus diseases.  I use it on my roses and other flowers and it stops disease, even fungus disease.  Highly recommend this product.
1114	1	Look, each pack contains two servings of 120 cal each, yet those servings serve up exactly zero taste.  They should make it one serving of the same number of calories but inject some taste.  They taste like someone forgot 1) salt and 2)sugar.  Wow.  Super bad.
1115	5	I have three different flavors of these curry and they are all exceptional. Since they are so convenient I find that I use them often for general seasoning. They are a wonderful staple to have on hand
1116	5	If you want unadulterated iced green tea, this is it! I don't like citrus added or any flavored iced tea, so this is one of the best plain iced green teas available. I hope Amazon starts to stock the more robust variation of this brand (dark green label) and the one liter bottles too.
1117	5	My Frenchie loves it.  She eats almost all of it (we feed her 2x/day) and stops when she's full.  I usually add 1/2 tsp of greek yogurt to her breakfast portion.  Her stool is firm and she's eats and goes on a pretty regular schedule.  It's pretty stinky when she passes gas, but it's not that frequently.  I haven't found a dog food to solve that problem though!  Overall, I'm very happy with this food for now (we've only been on it for a little over a week).  FYI stats: our pup is 12 weeks, eats 1-1.5 cups per day, about 8.5 lbs
1118	5	These may be the best popcorn/ chips I've ever had.<br />They melt in you mouth with slap your mouth with spices.<br /><br />I think you will love them too!
1119	5	I bougth this to use while nursing my newborn.  I started taking it when she was 2 days old.  Nursing has been great, she gets plenty of milk & I have no concerns about running out of milk.  This is my 3rd time nursing and this time has been the easiest, i dont know for sure if it's because of the fenugreek, but all i can say is that my baby is super happy.  so i would reccommend it if you are concerend about running low on milk.  Also, i read that this herb also is a great breast health support in general, and can help prevent breast cancer, which runs in my family.  So i will definatly continue taking it even after i'm done nursing!  Plus, i gave 5 stars b/c amazon has the best price for this.  I checked 3 other popular health stores and the best price is online!!
1120	5	I eat these tuna cups (or the salmon cups) almost daily.<br /><br />If you're looking for a nutritious snack, these cups really can't be beat.  If you're a bodybuilder or athlete trying to increase your daily protein intake, these are awesome.  If you're a parent trying to get your kid to eat healthy, getting them to like fish is a great idea.  If you're trying to eat 5-7 meals a day to lose weight, make one of these cups one of your meals, the protein fills you up and makes you feel good.  It also requires a bit of chewing to complete the eating experience.<br /><br />Why eat a nutritionally empty "100 calorie pack" of goldfish crackers or potato chips when you could have something like this that has only 80 calories and infinitely more nutritional benefit??<br /><br />I'll eat these alone, straight from the cup, basically anywhere since you don't need to refridgerate and you don't need a can opener.  I'll dump them onto salad, or mix with rice, quinoa, or beans.<br /><br />Here's the nutrition data off the back (for 1 2.7oz cup) at the time of writing:<br /><br />Calories 80 (10 from fat)<br />Total Fat 1g<br />Cholesterol 35mg<br />Sodium 15mg<br />Total Carb 0g<br />Protein 18g<br />Omega-3 EPA/DHA 200mg<br /><br />You really can't beat this for something so portable that requires no preparation or refridgeration.  The package says "in water" but there's a little bit of broth in the cup, and if you squeeze this out or just leave it at the bottom of the cup, you probably cut the sodium down to 10mg.<br /><br />I highly recommend these tuna cups and the salmon cups as well.  But, avoid the tuna salad, or the flavored varieties if you are looking to get the maximum nutritional benefit.  Those salads and flavorings just add salt, sugar, carbs.
1121	5	This is quite a good sized supply, a mix of clover, alfalfa, fenugreek, and radish. Not especially strong or "zesty" but certainly good!
1122	5	My throat feels so much less mucousy halfway through a set with the band if I'm drinking this instead of diet soda or beer!  Which means I sing cleaner and clearer!
1123	1	I got Teryaki flavored of the mega packs and yuck! The jerky was so hard and crunchy and old.... It said that it expires in 2013 but still it tastes so nasty so i threw it away and got a refund for my purchace. Amazon is great but these people sell nasty jerky, just go to the store to buy jerky
1124	5	I quit sodas over a year ago due to the unhealthiness of them.  I do, however, like bubbly drinks, but I don't need the sugar or sodium.  That's why this product is perfect.  It is 100% fruit juice, carbonated for the bubbliness.<br /><br />Orange is one of my favorite flavors.  This drink is the perfect drink.<br /><br />I think this product is even better than orange soda; orange soda is sticky, but this product is not.  It has the perfect amount of sharpness - which I love.  Because it is 100% fruit juice, it also has the perfect amount of natural sweetness.<br /><br />So this product is all the good things rolled into one:<br /><br />100% fruit juice<br />No added sugar<br />Bubbly<br />Awesome orange flavor<br /><br />It's so good, it's hard to believe you're drinking something healthy.
1125	5	If you like Chai Latte tea and don't want to fuss with making it the 'old Fashion" way, this is a good alternative.  Of course, you have to own a K-Cup coffee machine.  I've bought a few of these boxes of 24 k-cups.  The last time I ordered them they came in a package of 2 boxes (48 total) for about $32.  Now it looks like amazon is selling them as 1 box (24 k-cups) for about $18.  To me the key to buying this (or almost any item) on amazon is to do a search first.  There are many different sellers here and they all seem to have different prices and a different number of k-cups in their boxes.  Some add shipping and some have free shipping.<br /><br />As far as the tea goes, I really like it and would highly recommend it!
1126	3	It has a nice aroma but the flavor seems a bit light and its a light roast to boot. great expectations but short on delivery.
1127	5	My favorite uncle is diabetic, and I always feel awful when I invite him for my birthday and he can't join in on eating cake with the rest of us. I picked up a package of these and used them for a cookie crust on a cream pie with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1HVD4">Jell-O Sugar-Free Instant Pudding & Pie Filling, Chocolate, 1.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24)</a> and whipped cream lightly sweetened with non-sugar sweetener. The result was gorgeous and tasted pretty good even to those of us who can have sugar. For him? He told me "You know I can't have sugar." and when I told him it was sugar free he dug in with gusto. He said "It's not even my birthday and I feel like I got the best present."<br />It was so easy to make, and the crust was his favorite part. I gave him an extra package of cookies I bought and he enjoyed those a lot too.<br />Love these for making it so much easier to make special treats for my uncle.
1128	5	this coffee is so good n rich, never bitter. Its a smooth delicious tast. geting ready to order more now. Cant get it @ the store only on Amazon. u wont b sorry.
1129	5	Wonderful product. "Instantly" puts all "instant oatmeal" (except McCann's) products in the trash heap. It does take 30 minutes to cook, but following the directions on the can (4 cups water, 1 cup oats) this makes four breakfasts (just under 1 cup of cooked oats each) for me; it might make 5 for smaller appetites.<br /><br />I make it in the evening by starting with the water and oats, with just a touch of salt in the water. Stir the oats initially, then set a timer and leave it be on very low heat (just barely bubbling). At the end of 30 minutes, stir well, then I divide the oatmeal into 4 equal parts (usually just under 1 cup each) and put it into those little Glad Serv-n-Saver type containers (the "Tupperware" you don't mind losing!). Into each container ("bowl") I like to mix a handful of raisins (or other dried fruit, but raisins are my personal favorite), a dash or two of cinnamon, about a tablespoon of honey and a tablespoon of ground flax seed. I then mix each thoroughly and cover; then all 4 "ready to heat and serve" bowls go into the fridge.<br /><br />Each morning, then, I pour about a tablespoon of skim or soy milk on top of the oatmeal, then microwave for 1min 20sec (your oven may vary, of course). Stir, and enjoy; I eat it right out of the Serv-n-Saver bowl, which cuts down on washing, too! It's a wonderful tasting, quick and HEALTHY part of your breakfast. It's high fiber, so it's filling, which tends to cut your overall caloric intake and it goes a long way toward the American Heart Association's recommended daily fiber serving; most Americans are woefully below this in their usual diet.<br /><br />I highly recommend this as a part of a healthy, low-fat, low calorie, low glycemic and high fiber diet. It helped me drop my total cholesterol level over 40 points (as part of a comprehensive diet plan) WITHOUT drugs.
1130	3	It tastes better coming out of the liter containers that have a plastic pouring spout.<br /><br />I initially rejected O.N.E as a coconut water I would drink regularly after I tried it in the small pack with the foil seal, UNTIL, I found out that O.N.E in the liter packaging with the plastic pour spout tastes 100% better! I don't know why this is the case, but the packaging makes a big difference in the flavor of their water.  I suggest if you already like this water, do a taste test side by side.
1131	5	My sister found out about smoked paprika thanks to "Big Daddy's House" on the Food Network.  I use it constantly and find it as great a staple as garlic in cooking.  Smoked paprika indeed adds a beautiful smoked flavor to foods without the barbeque grill.<br /><br />Purchasing the small jars from the supermarket was getting too costly.  By purchasing the 1 lb. size, I have been able to refill my little supermarket spice jar at least four times with plenty over.  I am grateful to Wholespice not only for offering the paprika in bulk for an extremely reasonable price, but for their fast shipping.<br /><br />If you've never tried smoked paprika, please give it a try.  If you enjoy using it as much as I do, please buy it from Wholespice.  I truly believe that you won't be disappointed.
1132	1	This pad thai was a soggy, mealy mess, with no flavor at all.  Perhaps the worst food-out-of-a-box I have ever eaten.  I have to wonder if the Thai Kitchen company samples its own products before selling them.  They must not.
1133	5	I needed a size larger for my bonsai and this was just right. Plus like the look of the pot.
1134	5	These cough drops really do the job.  They "vaporize" into the whole head and they let you know they are working.  They are so much more than just a drop to take for a cough; they help with the throat and the congestion in the head.  There are no other cough drops worth the money you spend on them.
1135	3	They arrived in a large baggie (very thin like a produce bag from grocery store). The seeds were heavily salted with each seed encrusted in a thick chunky layer of powdered salt. Will NEVER buy this product from this supplier again!SEVERLY DISAPPOINTED!
1136	2	I'm a huge fan of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SWB73C">Instant Ginger Honey Crystals Pack of 30 Bags - 18 g Sachets</a> and was excited to try out Gold Kili Instant Ginger and Lemon Beverage.  I usually add lemon juice to my Ginger Honey Crystals anyways...why not try a brand that has it included?  You can drink it either hot or cold - I added hot water to mine, as I like ginger tea.  To my dismay, the Kili Ginger Lemon Bev was not very good.  The ginger has a very light kick, and wasn't as spicy as most ginger teas.  The lemon flavor was overpowering.  They should rename this the Lemon & Ginger Bev mix, as that's what it tasted like to me.  Even after adding a little milk and honey to it, it still didn't have a good flavor.  If you like the Ginger Honey Crystals, you probably won't like the Gold Kili brand...it's not particularly gingery and the lemon is too strong.  You're better off adjusting the lemon and honey ratio on your own.
1137	5	This is my new crack. I'm simply obsessed with Tazo's Earl Grey. It is so soul soothing.
1138	5	If your cat has "foul" breath after a chicken dinner (or even fish), these really do the trick.  Our cat loves them - no issues trying to get him to take them.  Tried them on the wife, but they do no better than listerine.  She'll kill me if she sees this!!!!
1139	4	These bars are very crunchy so you won't feel cheated in the chewing department.  They do crumble a lot so you will make a big mess eating them, it's unavoidable.  the only complaint is they can't keep them together.  They begin crumbling before you even touch the package.  They taste good for Granola and if it not for the mess I would prefer them over other bars.
1140	5	Bought these to use as party favors for a child's birthday.  They went over great and everyone loved them.  Who doesn't love a Pez?
1141	5	Great taste and wonderful for dieting. I know it's not technically raw in the sense that it is cooked at a high temp, but it's still better than any sugar. My husband has lost forty pounds since summer on a vegan diet and one of the things we use lots of is Agave Nectar. It has a lower glycemic count than sugar or honey and it tastes yummy.<br />We use it in smoothies, along with a little stevia. We top pancakes with it, use it to make vegan cakes or cookies.<br />I highly recommend it.
1142	5	Ive tried all the diet pop out there and I cant find anything that tastes as good as this. Hansen's is close but comes in second.  Besides, consider all the chemicals and crazy additives most of the other brands add into their pop. I understand exactly what I am putting in my body with this pop. So... Good Job to Blue Sky
1143	5	These are the best gluten free chocolate cookies that I've tried.  They taste a lot like oreos without the cream.... SO GOOD!
1144	4	They are a little picky, but they like it and we live in Asia and these are not available on base.
1145	5	I picked up this tea because green tea is supposed to be good for you. The quality of this tea appears to be very good and gives you that nice green tea body.
1146	5	These are the tastiest orange cremes I have ever eaten!!  The orange flavor is that of a high quality orange sherbet!
1147	5	MAde by the great brand that does adult snacks now for kids. all natural and organic. have great flavor and are good for you. my kids love them and I have ate a few myself. definately worth the price when u compare it to the cheaper not good for them fruit snacks.
1148	4	This is very tasty and easy, just be careful when mixing.  I got too much dark rum the second time and it was a little too strong.  I was very impressed with the ease and flavor.
1149	5	My dog, Dr. Watson (a 5-pound Yorkie) LOVES this product.  He knows the name of it so I have to spell it if I'm discussing it with humans.
1150	4	This are quite tasty cookies.  They have a fudge center and are very soft.  My only complaint is that they have a slightly artificial taste which is to be expected, I suppose.  While these are no replacement for fresh home baked cookies, they are a convenient substitute.
1151	5	I bought a bottle of this on a whim and was surprised at the excellent taste. This has a more interesting taste than a traditional white vermouth.
1152	5	for my daughter and she loved the bars.  Nice and crunchy with a great nutty, chocolate taste.  She shared them with friends on a trip and had to hide them so they wouldn't all be eaten.  I have given the friends the manufacturer name and steered them to Amazon to order them
1153	5	It is hard to find a BOLD Decaf-but this is it!!!  It is also hard to find this in a store, so thank God for amazon.com and Deals On Call for having this!  FAST shipping too, so you don't have to wait for your coffee!
1154	4	I ordered this instant tea to supplement the blueberry pomegranate pyramid tea bags I receive regularly. It's a quick, great Summer beverage--easy to prepare and simple to carry the slim pouches in my purse or lunch bag. My only complaint is that when made according to the package directions it is sickeningly sweet. I dilute it with more water or mix it with unsweetened instant tea.
1155	5	i thot these were a little expensive but bought even so.  was an excellent purchase, as i found these cookies DELICIOUS!!  don't know if i tasted too much ginger, but i'm a lemon lover.  i ate half a box upon receipt.  bad bad girl.  heh  i probably won't share;especially since ic the item is not on s&s any more.  i'm just hoping they will be in stock by the time my next delivery time is due. thanks for making these available amazon!
1156	4	The taste is good but subtle enough to not alter your consumption positively or negatively. I largely use this as a sodium supplement when NOT exercising (the scientific evidence is actually strongly against the use of electrolyte supplements during exercise: see Tim Noakes' excellent book Waterlogged for more details).<br /><br />Some misc. notes:<br />* They are sweetened with trace levels (&lt;1g) of sorbitol. I normally avoid any sugar alcohol other than erythritol because of the laxative effects but because the levels here are so low the sorbitol has no negative impact. And of course being a sugar alcohol and in such trace amounts it has no glycemic impact.<br />* Compared to other brands, the one negative is that these take quite a while (~10 minutes) to fully dissolve.<br />* There are some other negative ingredients like sesame oil (bad polyunsaturated fat) but probably in negligible quantities.
1157	5	I'm just starting to eat low carb and I was getting tired of eggs already.<br /><br />But I stumbled across this recipe at [...] for TVP Oatmeal and I find it to be quite good. Very easy to make and I'm a very lazy bachelor.<br /><br />I made a full batch and now can just add some extra soy milk and reheat it in the microwave. Jazz it up with lots of cinnamon, etc.<br /><br />Update. This also works very well as a filler for your low carb meatloaf. I add one cup to the recipe.
1158	5	Probably not. But close. I (reluctantly) tried the Whiskas Temptations regular chicken version, among about a dozen other "enticers", and detailed my experiences in a separate review of CAT-MAN-DOO BONITO SPRINKLES. This "natural" version may work even better as an appetite booster. Whiskas also makes other "natural" sounding versions with wild salmon, beef, and tuna. I have not tried these specific ones either and probably won't since I have a lot of test product leftovers to work through. I would like to echo the points made by the excellent review below.
1159	4	****<br />This is a good, albeit unexciting breakfast tea from Stash. It is made from blended black teas. I much prefer Stash's Organic Breakfast Tea and Stash's Irish Breakfast Tea because both of those have distinctive and pleasurable tastes. However, there is nothing wrong with Stash English Breakfast Tea and it is a good change from basic orange pekoe tea. It can be brewed nice and strong without getting bitter (by brewing it longer), a sign of a good quality tea. Recommended, especially if you enjoy a simple, basic tea.<br />****
1160	2	The sauce was somewhat flavorful, but thin and runny with a weak flavor.  Would not buy this again.  I expected more from Mannheim Steamroller.
1161	5	First tasted this candy on a trip to Canada a couple of years ago--had never seen it in the states. It was in a candy shop in Nelson, B.C. that had a wide array of licorice. When I asked the clerk for a recommendation on a good black licorice she said that this one, though not technically black, was a definite customer favorite. She gave me a sample and I was sold! I bought a bag and was soon sorry I had not purchased more. On our drive home we went through Montana and stopped at a little shop outside Billings that advertised over 40 different types of black licorice--but no chalk!<br /><br />This candy has a crisp shell and soft center with an indescribable licorice flavor. It makes my mouth water just writing about it.<br /><br />I am glad to see it available here, but wish it came in smaller quantities--I am the only licorice lover in my home and I already know my willpower where this candy is concerned.
1162	5	I am 15 years old and these chips are the best i have ever had in my entire life so if you're thinking of getting healthier chips for you're kids and or teens these are the way to go my favorite are the seasalt and vinegar but original and bbq are really good too
1163	5	As a post-WLS patient, this is my favorite way to get an extra boost of protein. I love it.
1164	5	I didn't realize it but my tea wasn't arriving as promptly as suggested. The company also noticed and sent a box out immediately! WOW! I was very impressed!
1165	5	I have always been partial to a chocolate combo with caramel.<br />Ghirardelli makes a good product and the individual wee bars are nice. I put mine in the fridge at this time of the year. Great price today (when I bought)<br /><br />Cadbury has a bar called Caramilk. The chocolate is excellent but the caramel not my favourite.
1166	4	well worth having it delivered for half the price of safeway. occasional dented boxes but krispies still ok inside. would recommend it to any family
1167	5	I have been grinding my own coffee for years. This is my first time to buy Jamaican Blue Mountain Style Whole Green Coffee Bean. Roasting my own coffee was new & exciting.  This is an excellent coffee and I will purchase again. Smooth an Well balanced.
1168	5	I like this stuff and tastes good; unlike most root beers, it is white color.  I have tried this with a seven-year-old and she prefers it over Virgil's and perhaps even over Fitz, which is my first love.
1169	4	These are a wonderful and healthy snack however they are way over priced. You can get them cheaper at Walmart for .88 a package. I pick them up every time I go. The problem is that I can't keep them around, they are so good I go through them quickly.
1170	5	My cat loved the chicken pot pie.  I was very skeptical, but she even ate the carrots!  Amazing.
1171	5	This syrup is delicious, 100% natural and organic, and a great deal, even when compared against Costco or other warehouse stores.  Most importantly, this is Vermont maple syrup, which is required by Vermont law to be produced with a higher level of purity and less water than maple syrup from elsewhere in the US (e.g., New York) or Canada.  Vermont maple syrup is as good as maple syrup gets, and this brand is good Vermont maple syrup.  When comparing this product against other syrups from New York or Canada, keep in mind that you're getting more syrup and less water, since Vermont maple farmers boil it down more to give you a more concentrated flavor.<br /><br />It's worth pointing out that Grade A dark amber is probably your best bet for pancakes, waffles and the like, having more flavor than the lighter Grade A syrups (light amber, fancy), and being a cleaner taste than grade B syrup.  The difference in grades and colors is based on which part of the short maple harvesting season the syrup is gathered in: Grade A dark amber comes in the heart of the season, later than the early-season lighter syrups, and before the trees are really warming up, when the baking-quality Grade B is harvested.
1172	5	I was concerned about the effect "regular" dog food was having on our dogs. We have one puppy and one senior, so both are in crucial stages. The puppy had bad dandruff and dull, course hair while the senior had various issues throughout his life including seizures and IBD. I decided to try a home cooked diet for them but after the pup developed an allergy I was scared to try anything else on my own. We decided to try Wellness after some research on the natural brands (not to mention a taste test with samples from Pet People).<br /><br />This food has done WONDERS. The pup no longer has dandruff and his coat is shiny and silky. His energy level is also through the roof. Our older dog has always been a veeery picky eater, sometimes going a couple days in between meals if it wasn't appetizing enough for him, but he loves the Wellness food and even eats it dry! No canned mix-ins necessary! Since he started eating it we haven't seen any IBD symptoms and he's acting a lot younger.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend this food, or at least another brand of natural food. I encourage you to compare the ingredients in Wellness to regular food as even  "high-end" grocer brands (like Science Diet) contain the same junk as the generic ones!
1173	5	These little things are gems. They store heat from your "too hot" coffee and release it later. Really perform great in an insulated mug adding hours to my coffee's drink ability.<br /><br />They are not:<br />-Ice cubes<br />-A miracle<br /><br />Best used with:<br />-Insulated coffee mug<br />-With a cover<br /><br />I use three in an older Thermos insulated coffee mug and my coffee stays hot for about 5 hours and still is warm enough to enjoy for a few hours after that. Before Joulies my coffee was too hot then just right and then cold after about two hours.<br /><br />Main point:<br />The coffee stays at about 140 degrees for hours so it can be enjoyed. Expanding the window of comfortably hot drinking temperature.
1174	5	OK. I purchased this last week and eat the first box without looking at back side...the effect was: I didn't eat my dinner at all because I felt disgusted all day long. This is just what Bertie Botts supposed to be. But don't try it if you are NOT OK with awful flavors.I took a VOMIT one thinking it was cinnamon...and blueberry flavor tastes like dishwasher. I give it a five star because it is perfectly awful, but don't buy it if you haven't decided how much you can take...just don't!
1175	5	have never had nestle fat free hot chocolate but purchased it for the great price.  the flavor is great and am glad i bought it. just dissapointed that when i went to purchase more it was at least double the price.
1176	5	Mars candy bars are an old time favorite. Chocolate covered caramel with nougat and whole almonds.  Never understood why they are no longer available nationwide.
1177	1	I purchased this tea because I was told that it helps with excess gas but this tea has made worsen my gas problem. I am very disappointed with the purchase
1178	5	The best ever, you can't stop eating them. No wonder the King of Belgium likes these cookies also.
1179	2	I purchased 3 of these from Amazon. They do work. So far, I have caught 2 moles in my yard and 1 in my neighbor's using the surface technique. One of the traps though has a dangerous manufacturing flaw. The thinner piece of metal on the top of the trap where the trigger bar and safety clip are attached broke on the trap after setting it only twice. I have also observed that over time and constant use the paint wears off this piece and the metal rusts, further weakening it. I have contacted Victor about this problem but have not yet heard back from them. Thankfully Amazon has a very liberal and easy return policy on defective items. See pic of broken trap in customer images.<br /><br />I would have rated this higher but Victor has quality control issues they need to address. This is what happens when you outsource your manufacturing to other countries like China.<br /><br />For those having problems setting these traps, don't follow the instructions on the box. See my pics in customer images on how to set these without having to use a vice or vice-grips.
1180	5	I got the coffee for 12.50 per box.  Ordered 4 boxes!!  Such a great deal, as the coffee is a great blend.<br /><br />If anyone is upset because of the website having issues when they were trying to buy it, they shouldn't review the product poorly, as it is not the product that is the problem.<br /><br />The problem is that you're jealous you didn't get such a great deal on the coffee.  Grow up kids, this coffee is great!!!  Will buy from Amazon.com, LLC again for more K-Cups for my Keurig.<br /><br />ALL OF MY COFFEE ARRIVED PACKAGED WELL AND IN NEW CONDITION, NOTHING WRONG WITH IT!!
1181	4	After reading the reviews, and noticing that most if not all of the positive reviews were from the chocolate company, I was really doubting whether I'd made a good choice - I got this as a Christmas gift for my mom - and it just got here. There really isn't any filler except in the smallest two boxes, and that's minimal - the rest is chocolate. The tower isn't as big as it looks - the pictures are a bit decieving, but I wanted a treat, not enough chocolate to make someone turn inside out from the sugar high. Overall, I'm pleased with it, though I probably wouldn't get it again.
1182	3	Everyone knows what Campbells soups are, but nowhere did I see in the description (it may have been hidden and I didn't read well enough) that these were clearly seconds. Given the sizes and positions of the dents and the fact that every single can was smashed in from a different angle, these dents had to be there before shipping. The box was in perfect order, the cans were not. At least they weren't expired! They all seem edible, but really -- dented! Come on! Yes, this was from Amazon.
1183	3	I buy these for the times when I am in a serious rush- just toss a few in the diaper bag along with some standard size nipples and rings and I can be out the door in a flash.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Fast and easy.<br />-I don't have to worry about them leaking all over my expensive diaper bag.<br />-I don't have to keep them refrigerated.<br />-The bottles are compact, so I can fit more in my bag vs. large bottles with water in them plus a container of  powdered formula.<br />-No washing bottles, only nipples and rings.  I stocked up on Evenflo and Gerber cheap plastic bottles and I have more nipples and rings than I know what to do with.<br />-Toss it out when you're done, so your diaper bag gets lighter and easier to zip as the day wears on.<br />-I think they even make disposable nipples for these, not sure though.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Very expensive compared to powder (and even more so compared to breastmilk- stupid school schedule making me dry up.)<br />-Unless you want to carry around another bottle to empty some of it into before the feeding, you have to use it right away, no refrigerating leftovers.  My son rarely eats 8 ounces at one feeding, so we waste 2-3 ounces per bottle.<br /><br />Overall, I think that they are prohibitively expensive when it comes to everyday feedings, but the cost is worth the convenience for the occasional outing.
1184	5	Compared with Arizona's bottled teas, this product is clearly the winner. It tastes fresh, while the Arizona pre-mixed tea tastes stale... like it sits in warehouses too long prior to being sold... which I imagine it does. Other instant tea mixes vary from poor to barely acceptable. This mix is "clearly and refreshingly" at the "tea-top!"
1185	5	Bought this at big box store and spent mega for it, but my Mal loves it. She chews on the treat until she gets a hole in the end of it, then slams it to empty the treats inside. Only down side is when she throws it, look out!She is a heavy duty chewer with powerful jaws, but can't get her jaws  completely around the large size toy. If she could, she would probably destroy it to get treats. She loves it and will go get it when it is empty so I can refill it.  I don't know if they are all the same, but it is hard to get the treat top onto her toy (I leveraged it with a screwdriver) this may be why she doesn't simply pry the treat "lid" out. It sure isn't because she isn't clever enough to do so. I more think she just can't get the right leverage because of the size of the toy. She can spend hours with it. Great toy.
1186	5	This was my first, but surely not my last, order of Bequet Gourmet Celtic Sea Salt Caramels. I purchased two 8 oz bags and only wish I had doubled that order. I will be making these a must-have around the house!
1187	5	My 2 beagles love this food, I was a little worried when reading the reviews about the weight gain some dogs were experiencing as Beagles have a tendency to put on weight. I was using adult lite formula and they would get hungry between feedings and would bug me until I gave them more food so whats the since in lite formula, I made the switch and feed them a little less each time and they are satisfied between feedings and love this formula, no gas,no runny stool. I would recommend this to all dog lovers who are trying to give their dogs the very best food they can.
1188	1	The smell of this coffee was nasty. I thought maybe the taste will be a little better, WRONG! Honestly, do not waste your hard earned money on this one.
1189	1	I didn't expect to receive the exact mix that is pictured, but I assumed that it would be representative of what we'd received. We received 4 flavored coffees (2 each of Golden French Toast and Pumpkin Spice). The other 20 coffees were a variety of blends, but not what I consider "flavored" coffees (Columbian, Nantucket Blend, Caribou Blend, Folgers Lively Columbian).<br /><br />So if you are looking for flavored coffees, I don't suggest this item!<br /><br />After re-reading the product description that says "This variety sampler includes only flavored caffeinated coffee.", I got even more annoyed. My package included only 4 flavored coffees and it also included decaf! So I decided to return the item - then learned that it was non-returnable. I followed the links to correspond with customer service, and after a few minutes of chatting with someone, they said that they'd refund my money. Doesn't sound like a standard policy - but I'm glad that amazon.com stands behind their website.<br /><br />JoAn
1190	5	This carrot juice is the best.  I've tried so many other brands and this is the tastiest.  We love the Carrot/orange and the Super Veggie too. It's healthy and great tasting...can't get better then that.
1191	5	Having the coffee in 3 separate packages allows me to open packages only as I need them, rather than having to open the entire 33 oz jug I would purchase before. I just reused the jug and empty the 11 oz packages in there as needed. While the packages equal the same amount of coffee in the 33 oz jug, having them packaged separately is worth the extra cost. In addition, with Subscribe and Save, the coffee is delivered as I need it.<br /><br />As for the coffee, yes I know there are better ones out there, but for the cost, it makes a great breakfast or after-dinner coffee.
1192	5	We give this to all three of our children when they have upset stomachs, and it has always worked.  The flavor is a little too strong for the 2 year old, so we typically put it over ice and water it down a little for him...then he loves it, especially when you mix it with honey.  WAY better than having to give the kids medicine like Pepto when something as simple and enjoyable as a tea can fix it.  We have been using the product for years, and my wife has used it through all of her pregnancies.
1193	5	Fun to make and the whole thing just tastes great!  It's probably as good if not better than a lot of the Chinese restaurants nearby.  The rice is light and provides a good base for the sauce and chicken.  The sauce is not too sweet, nor too sour and has chicken and veggies already mixed in.<br /><br />The only con would be the excessive amount of packaging, but I don't know how else they could make a kit that allows for cooking two separate components.
1194	5	I love Sriracha and did not know where to purchase it.  I am thrilled with receiving this large (28Oz.) size.  Ease of purchasing makes me secure in knowing where I can buy more.
1195	5	What a pleasure to find this great tea here at Amazon. Not available is stores where we live. I would recommend to green tea lovers anytime.
1196	3	I really didn't think there was anything special about this product. It doesn't have a bad taste, but it is different than a regular orange flavored soda. It is definitely not as sweet (which isn't a bad thing for me as I find the orange sodas way too sweet) and left a tiny bit of an odd aftertaste. It is a healthier alternative to regular sodas as there is no high fructose corn syrup, but it was still just as caloric. It is juice rather than artificial syrups, but the first juices listed in the ingredients are the overly sweet apple and grape constitutes, not orange and tangerine, to make the drink taste sweeter I suppose. Honestly, considering the price of this product and the lukewarm impression it left on me, I would rather just pour my own juice blend and add soda water or sparkling water to it myself. Most juices seem to be vitamin C fortified themselves, so unless you are just looking to replace the artificial sodas with something less damaging, I can't see a big benefit to this product.
1197	5	great tasting coffee. strong, but not obnoxiously strong and no nasty aftertaste. too bad, it cannot be purchased on subscribe and save anymore.
1198	1	I can only echo other parents - I have been buying this product only because of the Iron content shown on the package. My daughter actually hates the flavor, but I was trying to make her eat a pouch every other day hoping it will keep her iron levels high. Very disappointed that this mistake wasn't announced or anyhow made noticable; I found out about it just by luck - was bragging about these pouches and showing the iron information to my parents, and noticed that the last shipment (I have it on subscribe and save) has only 4% of Iron listed on the pouch.
1199	3	Country of origin is part of my decision making process.  I am posting this for others who may have similar concerns.
1200	4	This is a pretty good low end pu-erh, sweet and earthy. Because there can be some confusion about how to make it, here is how I do it.<br /><br />First I break off a suitable size chunk of it (I like to taste my tea, so I use more leaves). Then, I rinse this in my infuser with freshly boiled water. I then steep the tea in freshly boiled water for the following times:<br />1st infusion: 65 seconds<br />2nd infusion: 75 seconds<br />3rd infusion: 95 seconds<br />4th infusion: 210 seconds<br /><br />The first two infusions taste pretty strong, the third is noticeably weakening and the fourth is about half as strong as the first.
1201	5	I sampled Green Mountain's pumpkin spice coffee and was immediately hooked. It's a lighter roast but still not washed out, but best of all the cinnamon and clove flavor comes through at just the right intensity. So now I get the luxury of a pumpkin spice latte by adding warm skim milk and save all those sugar calories! What I especially love about this blend is that the clove comes through nicely. It's not overpowering but you can distinctly make it out. I love that, and if you love clove too I think you'll love it as much as I do.
1202	4	This spice adds good flavor to my cooking and has a fine consistency, color, and aroma.  The three pack is economical.  The price beats my local supermarket.
1203	5	Mark Rampolla introduced Zico in 2004 after discovering coconut water as a Peace Corp volunteer in Central America; it has been catching on ever since.  Why because it is great tasting; but most importantly it is great for you.  It contains more potassium than one banana and only contains 60 calories.<br /><br />Potassium is key and it has 15 times more than sports drinks;  as those of us who have problems with muscle cramping are relieved to know.  I think it is probably the  best natural drink that I have found to promote hydration.<br /><br />I love the natural, the passion fruit and the mango flavors.  All of them taste natural because they are..they are not sweet and the fruit flavors are really only the essence of the flavor itself and are quite subtle tasting.<br /><br />I can't think of a better or more healthy drink...in fact because of its potassium content, I consider it a better drink than plain water.  It also contains a healthy complement of phosphorous, magnesium and calcium with even a gram of protein.<br /><br />Enjoy this drink experience after exercising and you will never feel faint and/or dehydrated again.<br /><br />Bentley/2009
1204	1	Delivery fine. Kobe beef WAY short of expectations. Thought $32.50 a pound (delivered) was too good to be true.  Apparently, it is. Cooked 3 steaks thus far using 3 different methods found on the internet (no cooking suggestions included in shipment or on vendor's website).  All 3 attempts resulted in tough meat.(Seared 2 minutes per side and then cooked another 3 minutes turning often).  I've had more tender Choice ribeyes from Fry's in AZ at $4.88 a pound. Very disappointed. These steaks were graded 7-9 BMS (so I was told in response to my email inquiry). I find that hard to believe.
1205	5	This is the first matcha powder I've used so I am unable to comment on it's quality compared to other products. You do get a LOT for your money. These two boxes will last me at least 6 months.<br /><br />I read about this in Muscle & Fitness magazine for its numerous health benefits, mainly it's high content in anti-oxidants, cancer prevention, detoxification, increased fat metabolism and energy. One tiny measuring spoon of this stuff is 10 times more potent than regular green tea and it's noticable. I have been using green tea extract in capsule form and it is no comparison to the matcha powder. I feel more energized and alert without any jitters or insomnia. I feel less food cravings over the course of the day. My metabolism has increased. I am able to eat 100-200 additional calories per day (yes, I'm one of those calorie counters) yet my body fat has decreased by 2%. I also believe it enhances your immune system as I have made it through the entire flu season without getting sick from any of my contagious co-workers.<br /><br />The powder is easy to use. I micro-wave 1/3 cup of filtered water in a small cup, stir in a measuring spoon of matcha powder, then dump it into ice water or protein shake. The taste is creamy and does not require sweetener for my taste. I am a matcha convert for life. My next project will be making green tea ice cream with this stuff.
1206	4	These bars are very good and tasty, with the right texture, and with delicious oatmeal with honey touches. They came as a surprise for me, as i'm used to eat the generic energetic bars from the vending machine at work, that usually taste like cardboard and corn syrup.<br /><br />These aren't like that. They are sweet but not overwhelmingly so, with the taste of honey being very perceptible. The bars aren't "honey golden" in color as many supposedly honey products tend to be nowadays, but I see that as a good thing, because that color usually comes from caramel and burned sugar, not honey. Very good bars, in general.
1207	4	Product was good.  Bottle a little damaged.  Shipping was as always on Amazon, way too high.
1208	5	This is an awesome product.  Best spice chai I have ever had. I am a big fan of chai and have tried it at most of the big national franchise chains around the country.  None even come close to the flavor and smoothness of Big Train Chai.  I'm ordering more today.
1209	3	As another reviewer suggested, you really need to add another egg to this mix. I also added vanilla extract, some apple sauce, natural sugar and lots of extra water to get this mix to the consistency/taste I wanted. Even after all my modifications I still did not like the aftertaste but this seems to be the standard with all GF pancakes mixes I have tried. I am only 3 months GF so maybe I will get more used to the aftertaste as time goes on? Next time I make these pancakes, I will definitely make with blueberries. I still gave this mix three stars because my sons-ages 4 and 5 ate four pancakes each. They would eat more non GF pancakes but 4 is still a lot! I could stomach these and ate 3. I did not like Namaste at all though many have recommended it. I would like to try Pamela's too. Tried making some pancakes from scratch with Domata flour but have been very unsuccessful with this flour. I am a chef so I was really disappointed I could not make my old recipes as they suggested I could. Bottom line, I would recommend this mix with modification of an extra egg, more liquid, vanilla extract and a fruit or other addition of your choice. Best of luck and Bon Appetit!
1210	3	The taste is fine, but the K-cup container has opened at the seal during the brewing process on more than one occasion, resulting in a mouthful of coffee grounds!  I have never had this happen with any other brand of K-cup before and hope it is not the norm for Wolfgang Puck.
1211	4	I kind of expected something that would taste nothing like peanut butter. Not only does this stuff taste like regular peanut butter, it has the same consistency once you mix it. It has a taste similar to a low quality peanut butter or a high end less sugar healthy kind. Peanut butter has always been my weakness and I am so excited to have an alternative that wont kill my daily diet. It's even good enough to eat by itself without and kind of cracker etc. . .<br />The only down side, why I gave it 4 stars, is the price. It is much more expensive than regular peanut butter, but considering the trade off with so many fewer calories, I consider it worth it.
1212	2	This was a lot of work for such a small amount of results.  It would be appropriate for something such as home schooling, where there would be a LOT of hand's on help as the kit has to be seriously moistened several times a day to to produce mushrooms.
1213	5	I PURCHASE THIS ITEM BY THE CASE AND MAKE ORANGE JELLO FOR MY STUDENTS OFTEN. HOWEVER I USE ONE CUP BOILING WATER AND ONE CUP 100% ORANGE JUICE INSTEAD OF A SECOND CUP OF WATER. THE STUDENTS REALLY LIKE THE TASTE AS IT IS A STRONG ORANGE FLAVOR. THEN TO MAKE IT BETTER I SOMETIMES PUT WHIPPED CREAM AS A TOPPING. THE OTHER JELLO ITEMS SEEM BLAND IN TASTE COMPARED TO MY ADDED ORANGE JUICE JELLO.
1214	5	I was given Iams by the breeder when I purchased my 12 week old male Maltese puppy. After reading ingredients I wanted to do a change over to the Wellness and he loves it ! I had a lttle bit of the Iams left over so I mix what is left to the Wellness. He eats the Wellness first every time. I chose the better food for him and smart puppy chooses it also (: Happy !
1215	5	I absolutely love these shakes!  Previously, I was mixing my own protein shakes (chocolate whey protein with unsweetened diluted coconut milk, and a banana blended) every morning for breakfast.  Since I found Orgain, I no longer have to clean my hand blender every day and waste five plastic cups a week or carry around a dirty cup until I get home from work.  The taste is amazing (the vanilla is decent, but not nearly as good as the chocolate) and the nutritional content and organic ingredients are exactly what I was looking for.  It's smooth and creamy (not gritty) and, don't worry, you only taste chocolate, not the vegetable extracts, vitamins and minerals (the vanilla tastes significantly more mineral-and-protein-powder-like, that's why I wouldn't recommend it).  I have a degree in nutrition, I am a semi-professional chef, I'm active, and I'm very picky with what I eat, so I'm impressed that I like a product like this so much.  Usually there's something I would want to change (like removing artificial sweeteners, sugar alcohols, etc).<br /><br />I live near Los Angeles and the only place I can find Orgain now is at Ralph's for $2.99/ea + tax and they do not offer any sort of discount for bulk purchases.  They used to carry it at Whole Foods for a month or two and would offer 10% off if you bought 10 or more, but they have recently stopped carrying it.  If you like this product as much as I do, the cheapest way to get it is to subscribe to have it regularly delivered through Amazon, giving you an additional 15% savings from the already low price and you will also receive free shipping!
1216	5	I've purchased this item in a smaller quantity for an outrageous amount of money.  This is an extraordinary value!
1217	3	While the taste of the gum was about average, the fun of reading the insult more than made up for it.
1218	5	This is an excellent product.  I tried a handful that a friend had and I was hooked!  It has good flavor without being too salty.  You can also chop them and add to salads or in green beans.  My kids enjoy them also, good alternative to junk snacks!
1219	5	My sister got me these for Christmas after I put it on my wishlist. They are very good. They are quite sour, maybe even more than the sour straws.
1220	5	I have had celiac for awhile now and ive noticed how hard it can be to recreate certain recipes. This mix makes DELICIOUS pancakes and i also use this mix to make gravy or to thicken sauces or in desserts and ive even used it in a sasage ball recipe to make sausage balls that tast better than ones that arent gluten free. I like the soft texture this mix makes, its not spongey or weir i like it a lot.
1221	5	This is soooo addicting!! I serve it to customers, family and friends and it is now a favorite. I just make it with hot water and it is so good. Its also excellent over ice. Sure beats paying the coffee shop prices. PLEASE Amazon, keep this available online forever, also in the box of 25 individual packs as I tuck those into gifts, my purse, and when I travel, in my overnight bag. GREAT PRODUCT and GREAT PRICE!!!
1222	4	I love drinking illy coffee and it's great that they offer it in can form. For me, it's too dark and bitter, but it is still a great and bold flavor for those who prefer it.
1223	5	I went to Sam's club and bought a bag of assorted 5 1/3 lb. Child's Playtime Candy (assorted Tootsie candies the smidgees, pops, and ugh! Dots) I saw the wrapper and we thought they had a printing error with the color overlay. I tried it- it was like awesomeness in pop!. I wanted no other- it was sweet and fruity and not in an artificial way and it didn't taste like medicine (orange & grape) Now I don't know if that flavor is directly pomegranate but I am willing to trade all my chocolate candy, which I LOVE, just to get another pop. If you find it do not share!
1224	5	This is a very tasty, crunchy cereal with great flavor. I just hope that Amazon keeps enough in stock to keep up with demand. It's a good value to buy it in bulk from Amazon.
1225	5	Tastes great and is super easy to make.  It's not as good as brewed coffee, but for being instant, it's perfect.  Love taking this when we travel, so we don't have to use the low-quality coffee that often comes in the hotel room.  In the summer, I also like making iced coffee with this, no need to buy the special iced coffee mix.  I just barely heat the water, mix and add a little cream and some ice cubes.  Works well since I don't use sugar, so can't use the special iced coffee mix.  Recommended.
1226	1	This food is primarily corn: ground corn and corn meal. That food pyramid above the cat's head definitely doesn't represent what's in the food. I don't think most people would knowingly go out and buy corn for their cat. We associate cats with eating fish or poultry or mice. Definitely not ears of corn.<br /><br />And most of the meat is a byproduct, which is a low grade and questionable ingredient. So is "animal fat." It also contains wheat, which cats can easily be allergic to. This brand may be better than the bottom of the barrel cat foods, but it's still something to totally avoid. Purchase a cat food that is low in grains/carbs or has none at all. If it contains any then they should be wholegrain, like brown rice. No corn or byproducts.<br /><br />Your cat may seem fine on this food, but like a person eating fast food at every meal, you have to know there are healthier options out there and such poor dietary choices will catch up with you sometime.
1227	4	I enjoy these chips. I got these instead of my usual jalapeno ones from the same company for a bit of flavor change. I think those are better but only slightly, like the jalapenos there is a great amount of flavor without being too overpowering. The small bag size prevents you from overeating as with a larger bag.
1228	5	I have always liked snickers,<br />and to have it in a dark chocolate is a big plus..<br />Can't find it locally,.thank Lucifer for Amazon.
1229	4	First, we like the Emeril's Big Easy k- cups. Full flavor and nice aroma. I don't like ordering  a 50 count and receiving 49. Second time This has happened. They never error in favor of the customer. The coffee is just tossed in a big box loose and probably don't think anyone  will take time to count.
1230	5	These are spicy and salty, and highly addictive if you don't worry about the salt content. I am sure after the case of 12 I will die of kidney damage one day. But they are that good.
1231	5	These nursette bottles are such a lifesaver for nighttime feedings!!!! Just shake it, open it and screw on a collar ring with nipple.  These packages only come with one nipple.  I found that the Gerber essentials bottles nipples and rings will fit these nursette bottles wonderfully!!!  A 3 pack of those bottles only costs a little over 3 bucks at the big box store.  I purchased 9 of them to make sure I had nipples on hand to use just for these nursette bottles.  The formula works fine for my baby and these bottles are just so handy. No mixing, or cleaning bottles.  I'd highly recommend them.  Another point is that these come in an 8 pack and Enfamil's version only has 6 in a box and are a buck or 2 more expensive.
1232	5	I really enjoy Dandy Blend.  Since I am unable to drink caffine, I find Dandy Blend to be an alternative that is delightfully tasty and yet not overpowering.  Since Kraft no longer makes Postum, which was my non-caffinated drink of choise, this turned out to be my favorite substitute.  I highly recommend this for anyone who is intollerant of caffine. This was recommended to me by a friend who can drink coffee and yet still enjoys this as a caffine substitute that can be consumed throughout the day without having to worry about getting a caffine-high during the middle of the day.  This is a wonderful alternative to coffee for those who are unable to drink caffinated drinks, is reasonably priced if you buy in bulk quantities (2# bag highly recommended).  Goosefoot Acres shipped it right out and I was back in simulated coffee heaven in short order!
1233	5	I had hoped to like this product.  I loved it!  Having been gluten-free for more than 25 years, I've been thoroughly underwhelmed by the different gluten-free cake recipes being passed around at our local gluten-free support group.  But this is as close to an "original" (i.e. gluten-containing) cake mix as anything I'd ever tried.  Betty Crocker has really done their homework on this product!
1234	1	I ordered the Original Beef Jerky, 3.25-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4) and I got it today. But after I opened the box I noticed that there are only 3 bags in the pack, and the pack is opened already. Very disappointed with this order! I have shopped through Amazon for many years, and this is the first time that appeared a problem.
1235	5	I love my Keurig, but the cost of the cups had me looking for a better deal, and I was getting tired of adding to the plastic in the world with every cup of coffee.  I tried peeling the tops and bought the new lids to iron on (too messy and time consuming) and I do have the refillable cups you can use repeatedly, but those are messy, too.  I always thought the goal of a Keurig was a quick single cup of good coffee without the mess or fuss of a regular coffee maker. During a recent browsing day on Amazon, I ordered this product.  Surprisingly, the missing bottom to the cup is not an issue!  Spouse and I love the coffee, it is rich (read strong) enough for him, and tasty for me (I add a little hot water to mine.)  If you want to recycle the grounds, they are much easier to get to since you only have to tear open the paper basket on the bottom.  The cups come in sealed bags of 10 cups at a time to preserve freshness, so buying 80 is no problem.  This purchase was cheaper than my local Costco, too.  I also bought the decaf, and it is great as well.  Definitely a recommend!
1236	5	I mix 2 scoops of this and two scoops of formula in my son's bottle and it keeps him full longer. My mother says she used it on me when I was a child and it kept my cheeks rosy and me full. My son seems to really enjoy it.
1237	5	I love the BBQ Pop Chips.  They have a little zip to the flavor and are better than most BBQ chips.  The individual bags are great for taking them with you and watching your portion size.  I love the convenience of the auto-ship program.  I never run out.
1238	4	I tried this out on sale. Poured it into the bowl. Cat took one taste and then shoved her whole face into the bowl. She was shoveling up the food with her mouth wide open, spilling food everywhere. It was hilarious. It passes the taste test for sure. Very expensive though. I'll buy it when I can find an affordable price. (Five stars for ingredients and taste, one star docked for affordability.)
1239	4	As far as cookies go, this isn't going to ruin your diet (much) and it's pretty tasty too!  Three cookies, and they aren't tiny cookies either, are 140 calories.  There are 2g of both fiber & protein.  They aren't too sweet, which is great for me.  These are called "cookies" but they seem more like crackers.  They are kind of dry, which I don't mind, but the blueberries make them a little chewy.  The ingredients DO NOT list sulfur dioxide (a color preservative for many dried fruits).  Yay!  Sulfur gives me hives anyway.<br /><br />As of right now, these are $18.22 per package for 4 packages of 10 servings each.  I'm hoping these become subscribe & save items.  These are good & I will probably get them again.
1240	5	I loved buying a case of popchips for $13.42.  I would buy them on a regular basis if they were that price.  The product was great, the service was great also.  altogether a 5 star experience.  But now they've gone up by 70%.  Any chance of selling them to me at the original price?  Thanks, Susanne
1241	5	Very pleased with service and product.  It was a surprise gift for a very good friend who loves Stuckeys Pecan Logs so I decided to send some to her.  It was a great idea and everything went very smoothly.  I will gladly go through Amazon again for gifts and itmes for myself.
1242	5	My entire eats gluten-free due to having 3 celiacs. We first tried this pasta at an Italian restaurant in San Francisco and were blown away with the taste and texture. It was just like wheat pasta! We've tried many brands of brown rice pasta, corn pasta, corn/quinoa blends and this is our absolute favorite.
1243	5	A great product at a great price. I prefer this product to the honey that I used to use because it is less sweet and it does not crystallize.
1244	5	This is the gelatin that is recommended in the WAPF Wise Traditions 2011 Shopping Guide.<br /><br />I ordered my first bottle of it a month or two ago, and have used it several times to up the nutritional content of homemade broths and soups. I haven't made "jello" with it yet (using fruit juice) but I can tell you that it smells WAY better than the cheap Knox brand gelatin.<br /><br />I made "jello" using Knox gelatin one time and it had an off taste, because the gelatin powder smelled weird. The Bernard Jensen gelatin smells good, so I imagine that fruit juice gelatin made with it would taste very good.<br /><br />Amazon's price is good, too. Radiant Life is currently selling the same size bottle for $15. If you can score free shipping by ordering something else at the same time then you've got yourself a great deal.
1245	5	My son loves these puffs... they do have a bland vegetable infused asian rice cracker flavor... not too sweet at all :)  the taste is close to baby mum-mums... definitely the least sugary baby rice puffs we have have tried. Oh and the ones i received said that the puffs contain choline-- which is a supplement like DHA that promotes brain development -- which wasn't shown here on Amazon so that was a good surprise. I will be buying this again. Shipment was super fast! thank you amazon mom prime!
1246	5	Just received my coconut oil today and I am over the moon excited about this product!!! It has so much versatility! I'm was going to just use it for my natural hair, but I decided to order another one today for the other health benefits! Fast shipping, always a plus! This product is a must have!!!
1247	4	We switched our three dogs to Yummy Chummies after we almost lost one to the chicken treats from China. The dogs love them and they are good for their coats and diet. They make an excellent training treat and can be broken up into smaller tidbits if necessary.  This is the first time buying them on line and they seemed slightly less moist than the ones we bought in the store.  Very happy that they are made in the USA and will continue to provide them to the dogs.
1248	3	This fathers day basket set looks bigger in the pic totally false when I received it,opened the large box it was saftly shipped in and out I pulled this small cute package very small!
1249	5	The are great granola bars. I've bought them for a long time and continue to love them. The almonds in them are a great touch, and they're sweetened by dried cranberries. There's also enough there to make it filling for a small snack.<br /><br />Consistency-wise, they are a bit sticky. I usually hold them with the wrapper when I eat them. They are definitely chewy (especially as compare to the Nature Valley crunchy granola bars, which are really, really crunchy), but because of all the nuts and crispy things, they're still a bit crispy. I like the consistency and have no prob with it as others have said they do. I also don't find them too crazy sweet (I tend not to like super-sweet things). The nuts and slight bitterness of the cranberries balance it all out for me.<br /><br />Again, I've always loved these granola bars. Give them a try.
1250	1	Bragg markets this product as "no salt added" and "Healthier than soy" while she herself advocates raw and natural food. This product is made by chemically processing "liquid soy protein" in a way that chemically creates table salt and strips glutamic acids from the soy proteins, creating MSG.<br /><br />Naturally fermented soy sauce starts with the same base, is obviously fermented rather than chemically processed, does add salt but is able to use healthier salt than the chemically made salt in Bragg's, keeps the glutamic acids bonded to the protein, boasts the same assortment of amino acids, and doesn't cost any more than Bragg's.<br /><br />In short, Bragg is hypocritically marketing a product with no advantages over a good-quality soy sauce.
1251	5	I love this coffee. I usually drink Coffee People Jet fuel and still love that but I had a sample of this and now I switch between the two. Sign up for auto delivery. It makes Keurig life so very easy. I haven't had to think about buying coffee for three years. Thanks AMAZON PRIME AND AMAZON SUBSCRIPTIONS!!!
1252	2	First off the noodles get very broken up from the packaging (probably the shipping and handling), so you wind up with nearly a quarter of a bag at the bottom in small pieces, the other problem is that they just do not have much flavor and they do not offer a great texture to the meal.  I tried to make these with some teriyaki and chicken stock, and they came out mushy and flavorless, they do not seem to absorb and flavor from the dish and they get soggy like and do not hold up after cooking.  I frequently enjoy making noodle dishes and have never had noodles that came out so bland and textureless as these did, even when cooked with intense flavor items.  I much prefer Maifun Rice Sticks, and will probably stick to them for future entrees.<br /><br />Maybe in certain dishes you can make use of these noodles, but for the meals that I like, I will have to continue to use Rice Sticks and Chinese Noodles.  My only other flaw with these noodles is that they get crushed in their packaging, and causes for the majority of the noodles to be broken at the bottom of the bag.
1253	2	I have tried a couple different brands of Matcha teas, and this was definitely the cheapest, and well, "you get what you pay for."  This tea is a dingy looking, "pea green" and fairly bitter... whereas other higher quality more expensive brands are brighter and fresher tasting (the brighter the tea the BETTER quality it is).<br /><br />Although green tea is ingredibly healthy, you HAVE to be very careful about your source since manyof the poorer quality green teas (particularly those grown in China, Pakistan, and India) contain potentially high levels of metals such as fluoride, lead, and aluminum. Just FYI...aluminum in the body has been linked with Alzheimer's disease.<br /><br />So if your going to be consuming green tea on a *DAILY* basis, spend a little more money for some healthy and PURE green tea!
1254	5	i have ordered from this company before - the cookies are completly yummy.  the last time, the cookies were accidentally not gluten free.  an email to the company brought a very quick response, and a new batch of gluten free cookies delivered posthaste.  friends who benefitted from the leftover not gluten free cookies want to order some for themselves!  you gotta try these!!!
1255	1	Looks like and tastes like chocolate colored water. No chocolate flavor whatsoever, this was a complete disappointment.  I got the hot chocolate k-cups from swiss miss instead.  How people can be giving this product four and five stars is astounding to me, is the Amazon ratings system being gamed for this product?
1256	4	I like this tea, and its a good value, but I feel like it isn't full bodied tasting as some other roasted rice teas like that of yamamotoyama.  For me it's almost like drinking hot water.  Would be a great tea for somebody that likes  a light subtle tasting tea before they go to bed.
1257	4	this a great snack... the spicy taste is a kick. my only complaint is that this is a big salty.
1258	3	I've only had ALO aloe vera drinks before and I like that taste of them in general. Fruity tea like beverage with the aloe vera bits that make it all worthwhile.  This aloe vera drink in particular reminds me more of the sugar infused tea drinks like Lipton's Citrus Tea or Arizona Tea than something remotely healthy. I mena it's really sweet and I almost suggest watering it down a bit. Other than that it's not bad but I wouldn't drink it for any health benefits.
1259	5	After trying anything and everything on the market for the last 11 years, we found happy hips and stopped looking elsewhere. Have never seen my boy bully react the same way to any other snack, and was even more extra tic than him that he wasn't allergic to it either.
1260	5	I am practicing a vegan diet and this is an excellent product with a very good shelf life. I also buy some tofu that you can keep in refrigerator (which cost me $0.99/ea + tax). But I like to take this one with me when I travel and just to have some on hand at home (in case I run out of refrigerated tofu). Excellent product!
1261	3	The Quaker Dinosaur Eggs are a fun way to entice children to eat breakfast.  I like them too, and I'm a grandma!  They were a little pricy but I had some credits that I wanted to use up.  Delivery took two weeks.
1262	5	This food is amazing... we've tried numerous types of foods... (Royal Canine RX, Hills RX, most of the top named grain free dry kibble, frozen Raw).  She has a hard time digesting hard kibble & will eventually stop eating the raw patties.  This is the only food that our shih-poo has consistently gobbled down day after day.  Very easy to prepare.. mixes well if you decide to add in a little more meat.  This has not upset her sensitive stomach.. we are very pleased with this food!
1263	5	THis is probably my favorite Nuun flavor of all of them and I have tried most.<br />It is the perfect balance of flavor, not too strong.
1264	3	We've tried most major brands of cat litter, but we've found Arm & Hammer products to be the best with our automatic litter boxes. I've tried every type of Arm & Hammer litter and while this type is good, I think I'm going to stick with the "Double Duty" (no pun intended) brand here:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004U8Z436">Arm & Hammer Double Duty Clumping Litter, 40-Pound</a><br /><br />The Double Duty remains my favorite as far as longer-term odor control is concerned (as needed with any automatic litter box.)<br /><br />Average price without the hassle of lugging it around the store. Very satisfied with the manufacturer and Amazon's delivery options.
1265	5	My cats love this food, they eat it as it is a treat :) I also love that I can zip the bag - very convenient! Please make all large cat food bags zipped!
1266	5	In my quest to duplicate the taste of my favorite White Chocolate Mocha drink from the local coffee house I needed to find a White Chocolate Sauce that would duplicate the flavor.  I love Ghiradelli chocolates so this is the first one I tried and I have not changed since.  We are now on our 4th bottle of the stuff in as many months and unless they stop making it I will not change.<br /><br />One thing that many forget to do and may be the reason for the above posters issues is you need to give the bottle a good shaking when you recieve it.  The sauce will seperate a little over time.  You can see this by pumping some out first and then shake it up good and pump some more out.  You will see a difference in the two samples.<br /><br />Either way, in a 16oz coffee cup I use three pumps of the sauce(I like my coffee a little on the sweet side), with about 4oz milk and then my favorite dark blend of coffee and this gets very close to the taste I grew to like and costs me a fraction.<br /><br />I have also tried the powder but that did not taste as rich and creamy as the sauce.
1267	5	I really loved the taste of this coffee<br /><br />I personally like the taste of Lavazza coffee<br /><br />better than that of Illy coffee.<br /><br />Both of them are excellent, but Lavazza has its<br /><br />own unique taste to it.<br /><br />It is reasonably priced also.<br /><br />It's just great.
1268	3	This produces a medium strength, decent cup of coffee.  The flavor is not too strong, a bit unusual, but not memorable.  I bought it because it  was on sale and would buy again if I got a good price during Thanksgiving or Xmas.
1269	3	clearly the more expensive puzzle games may offer more, but for what you pay, this is nice.  My dog enjoyed it, and caught on after a try or 2.  at first she took the yellow cover and ran... thinking that was the prize, but i called her back to show her the treats, and then it was on!
1270	5	I was atracted to this item by reading the reviews, and added it to my wish list. I just received it as a birthday gift and, indeed, it arrived in great shape, very lightly yet intelligently packaged; it made it all the way from West coast to East coast, in plain winter weather!!! The seller was really thoughtful, left instructions for receiving the package as well as for plant care in an earlier email rather than in the box itself. A good experience, and I recommend this product.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002P2RMGQ">10 stalks of 8 inch SPIRAL Lucky Bamboo (18" tall top to bottom)</a>
1271	5	I bought my Yorkie and Golden Retriever one of the Tug-A-Jugs and filled it with the Premier Buddy Berries Dog Treats. They love to push and pull the Tug-A-Jug around the floor until they can get one of the Berries treats to come out. It's very obvious that they love these treats! I would recommend them to anyone who is looking for a small treat to put into the Busy Buddy toys.
1272	5	Nice tea, the aroma was great, nice to have a hot cup of tea and a good book when the weather turns cold.
1273	3	So I've never had mulberries so curious and bought some cuz it's good for  you.  the berries are supersweet without much flavor so if you're like me that's what it taste like to me.  I'm not into sweets so it's really not to my taste but my mother seem to like it okay.  so the rating is based on her reaction to it.  I'm hoping to use it to replace sugar in my baking because i can't eat it dried like that.  =)  I soaked it in water then cook it to reduce the water into a syrup.  works pretty well i think you can replace simple syrup with theses.
1274	5	I was very skeptical about trying this product, but it is delicious! Even when mixed properly, the texture is not quite like commercial peanut butter.  To me, however, the flavor is almost identical to natural peanut butter.
1275	5	I have tasted a bunch of coffees. And this is one of the best flavored. I will continue to reorder the JFuel  and from this seller. Also. This seller is quick. My coffee was here in 3 days. USPS. And I ordered over a holiday weekend.
1276	5	I originally bought the bottles from the grocery store. I found the canister on one occasion, tried the mix and was pleased, but I couldn't find it, again. The bottles were heavy to carry so my preference was the mix. Less storage space required was another advantage of the canister. I decided to look on Amazon and was pleased to find it. I'd give this six stars if I could. I have a prescription for this item.
1277	5	Good long lasting flavorful gum at a great price.Hard to find in my neck of the woods(Long Island).Won't kill ur teeth too!
1278	4	This product is made in Thailand with what appears to be really nice white meat chicken and some sort of dark bits.  The dark bits I guess are made out of chicken, but appear to be manufactured - like hot dogs - you know fillers and dyes.  Plenty of juice and chewy looking.  I purchased the cheaper pouches - Choice Cuts -, but those do not compare in quality to this one.
1279	5	This is one of very few dog foods at my local Walmart that lists beef as the first ingredient.  Most of the others are made primarily from corn meal.  I'm no dog food expert, but I would think that's a definite plus.  It is not the cheapest food you can buy, but the price is on the low end, especially when compared to small bags of premium brand dog food.  The bits are well-sized for small breeds and my 10 pound dog has no trouble at all.
1280	3	Got this at an incredible price on subscribe and save, that is no longer available.  We go through this cheese pretty fast...so for economics switched to this over fresh grated.  Works really good as an ingredient for flavor rather than a topping.
1281	1	Just opened my box of 192 Mini-Moos today, the expiration date shows September, however the whole box is trash.  Leaking moo cups inside, stuck to the inside of the box.  The ones that are not leaking are curdled.  Nasty.
1282	5	I love this coffee!  I ordered more of it!  Yes I would recommend to others! Comes packed nice<br />and the coffee is really good!  I'm going to try other flavors!
1283	5	Since my daughter is 14 months old she pretty much eats what I prepared for meals, however sometimes I don't think what I have made is something she should eat such as steak (too hard to chew).  So I like to have these available for a quick meal to prepare for my daughter.  She likes the taste, simple to prepare, and you have meat and vegetables all in one meal.
1284	5	I first received Gimmee Jimmee's cookies from the salesman after I bought a new car from Freehold Ford in Howell, NJ as a thank you. They are very delicious cookies. Packed very well and always received fresh. The chocalate chip and oatmeal are to die for. I have gone on to send their cookies to others to commerate birthdays, get well etc. I think you will be pleased with your purchase if you give them a try.<br /><br />Blanche
1285	5	Best vanilla wafers on the planet!!!!  I'm totally bummed since I moved to Colorado this year.  They aren't available here.  I don't understand it though.  They are distributed by Kelloggs.  Sigh!
1286	5	After ordering on line, we had a fast delivery, which was much appreciated. The Newman's Own Organic Cat foods I could not find in my local stores. My 19 year old cat is finicky and we had finally found a food with nutrition in that she would eat.  Thanks Amazon.com.<br />Vivian Slabaugh<br />Kingston, Tn.
1287	5	The soy milk is great.The price is comparable to the grocery store, but getting a dozen boxes at a time means we don't have to go to the store every other day.
1288	5	These are a great snack if you want something spicy and beefy.  The batch seems pretty fresh and they always taste great.
1289	5	I found these by accident in a local Dollar Store a couple of Christmas's ago.  Made the recipe on the package and everyone loved them, the dough is pretty tasty too!  After Christmas I purchased the remaining bags the store had but they never got them back in.  Couldn't find them in local stores either.  I went online and found them on Amazon, thank you for carrying them.  I ordered half a dozen bags to have on hand.  Quick service from Amazon.
1290	5	I was always hung up on vegetable oils and canola oil until my sister asked me to try Nutiva Coconut Oil..I was a little reluctant at first and now I am Hooked!!<br />I will not use anything else now..I've lost 25lbs just by eating a little healthier and sauteeing my food with this product..I even use it as a salad dressing..<br />I Love It!! I will always listen to my big sister well not always...But I will when she has my best interest in creating a healthy lifestyle...
1291	5	These  were recommended by my nutritionist as a portion and calorie controlled snack. One bag is filling and satisfying!
1292	4	My 20 month son loves these pouches. We call them "squeezers" and any time I ask him if he wants one he gets extremely excited and says, "yeah yeah yeah!!"<br /><br />At less than half the price of Revolution Foods and Plum organics versions, these are a great alternative. I realize these are not organic, but they are all natural and there is no added sugar, so I still feel good about giving them to my child. At .16/oz (subscribe & save price) they are only slightly more expensive than buying applesauce cups at the supermarket.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend the GoGo Squeeze for an excellent on-the-go snack. If you're staying at home, I'd suggest trying Mott's "Healthy Harvest" Peach Medley or Summer Strawberry. My son loves those too.
1293	5	Unlike some of the other reviews, mine were not expired or not even close to being expired. These were carefully packaged.  This is just like buying from the store, just a lot cheaper at the price I paid.  I'm very happy with my purchased and saved about $4 total.  Another good buy from Amazon!
1294	5	My husband and I are not big coffee drinkers. We find in the morning it is much needed, but......ONLY IF......we have this NESTLE FAT FREE cocoa powder mix as the sweetner. We don't use creamer, milk, or sugar, but love this as the sweetner. We are both watching our weight and find this wonderful as it has very few calories, low sugar, and no fat. If you haven't tried it in coffee, you really should. Our local grocery store we shop had not had it for a few weeks. I was almost out, and couldn't find it. I went on line to Amazon, and not only found it, but found it in the canister, and cheaper than buying all the individual packets. We like this better because you can scoop and measure easier. I would highly recommend this product, just save some for me. Can't live without it now! I'm hooked! Hope you enjoy too.<br /><br />Sonya Hamilton
1295	5	These pods provide superior flavor and are very easy to use.  If you're looking for a great flavor in an ESE Pode, I highly recommend this one.
1296	5	I had been buying the store brand for years but Skippy reminded me why it's okay to spend the extra few cents to have better taste.
1297	2	My main issue with this product is that i received the old formula with the old label. I wanted to try fast twitch because it was apparently caffeine free. That may be the case with the new formula but not the one i received. I have used it two times now and the product is a good pre workout supplement offering a good pump and good energy boost, however, it is not my favorite. Besides the caffeine that wasn't supposed to be in it, my second issue is the taste. It's a very potent pre workout compared to a Superpump Max by Gaspari that tastes more like a juice. Fast twitch is just very strong. I'm not totally sure if i did not mix it into enough water. Bottom line is that for the price it is worth it to try it out because you may see better results.
1298	5	These oreo's were great, my family gobbled them up without conscience, i even had to hide some packs around the house so they would not over eat them hahaha. All i can say about these is Excellent i would reccommend these to every one. We even got a few people hooked as you dont see these in your every day supermarket in Denmark. Just great taste, fresh and delicious.<br />Yours Natasha (DENMARK)
1299	4	these are really good noodles, nice flavor, zesty, easy to prepare. I am going to buy more!
1300	5	......but a close second and much cheaper.  it seems that the Violet Crumble might have had a floral flavor....this one doesn't, but if you like HONEY COMB, you will like this candy bar
1301	5	I purchase these mints every year for my son.  He says it isn't Christmas with the mints he remembers as a child.  He is 31 years old now.....
1302	5	I just got through reviewing another brand of litter (Arm & Hammer Essentials) that I used when I ran out of Feline Pine and it was awful.  Trust me, I'm stocking up on Feline Pine because it's in another league.  First, it's not scented or perfumed in any way.  It has a slight cedary smell that is pleasant and your cat likes and is drawn to.  Second, it has large "pellets" that disintegrate when your cat pees so you can tell if they are using the box (that's important if you are concerned with urinary issues and want something natural.)  Also, if your cat has recently had surgery and you are concerned about litter getting into the stitches and impeding the healing process, try this Feline Pine or Wheat Scoop, both are natural and easy to use and will not hurt your cat.  Finally, with this litter you don't have to worry about your cat breathing in harmful dust particles that cause respiratory issues and allergies.  It is expensive litter, don't get me wrong--but I have learned over time that it's worth the cost because it is safe, easy to clean up, and your cat likes using the litter box more with Feline Pine so there tends to be less bathroom "problems".  This is not powdery and won't coat every surface with dust.  It is "chunky" and pellet-like, won't get in your animal's eyes and cause irritation, and does seem to absorb odors effectively.
1303	5	This tea is great, just like Grandma made. It's sweet, but you also taste the tea. Not like some that is just sugar water. Excellent product!
1304	5	I switched to an Ayurvedic hair care regimen nearly a year ago. This product along with other herbs (like Brahmi, Amla, Neem & Godrej Nupur Mehendi Powder) when mixed with Bhringraj or Neem oil acts as an effective treatment against brittle hair, hair loss, and dryness. I use this mix as a deep conditioner, and apply it to my hair every three weeks. My results? Stronger hair that's no longer brittle and major growth (compared to when I wasn't using this product).
1305	5	I Really like this Lemon Extract it is of premium quality with excellent results I do a lot of Baking and use many different Extracts and they are all made with a very high percentage of alcohol is the only way, Vanilla, Vanilla Nut, Orange, Coconut, Butter, Banana, Lemon, Anise, Extracts, I use them all, except for Almond extract, we don't use that one too much. I am always looking for different Brands and some are very good like this one. We make Pound Cakes of various flavors, among many other things, and the Lemon and Orange ones are some of my Favorites. Thank You
1306	5	Our Cocker Spaniel Tinker Bell got this from Santa, and she picked it over all the other treats. It was gone in no time.
1307	5	I ordered some in all the flavors. These people know how to make jelly candies. Hats off!!
1308	5	My cat was born in August 2001, so he's almost 10 years old. Three years ago he started to throw up quite frequently. The vet ran tons of VERY EXPENSIVE tests and for the most part ruled out anything that can be treated. We tried changing food but nothing worked. I tried giving him home cooked food as well and that made throwing up even worse. So one day I was in a pet store and the clerk said he had the same problem with his cat and suggested the MOST EXPENSIVE FOOD IN STORE. I was skeptical but I had nothing to lose (but money). Three years later my cat is doing fantastic. He only throw up when I feel bad for him and give him tuna as a pity treat. He's healthy, bouncy and seems to enjoy food. The big bag lasts us for ever. We bought a bag on November 5th and today again on March 19. That's 4+ months for $40 (which is how much the bag costs in pet store). I think I can afford $10/month for my buddy. I have no idea what's in there and I don't really care. All I care is that my cat looks happy and healthy. Food purists who believe in feeding cat organic chicken and brown rice might not care for it.
1309	5	This is my favorite coffee for the Tassimo. It's not too weak or too strong! Use subscribe and save to get an even better deal.
1310	5	My doctor originally referred this tea to me after 1.5 months post-delivery. I've been using this tea for about a week now, and feel that I can confidently say that it does increase milk supply. Now I was drinking tea (Tazo Awake, Bigelow English Breakfast, and any green tea) several times a day on a regular basis, so it wasn't the extra fluid intake that caused the milk increase. Prior taking this tea, I was getting around 2-3 ounces when using a breast pump. After about 3-4 days of using the tea, I am getting anywhere from 3.5-5+ ounces per pump session. Not bad at all. :)<br /><br />The tea does taste very herbal and earthy (kind of like a Chinese herbal shop/pharmacy, or Dong Quai). Though it didn't bother me, it could be strong for some who are used to lighter smelling teas. A good way to counteract the taste, is adding a spoonful of honey which goes really well with the tea's naturally sweet flavor.
1311	4	This coffee is moderate in flavor (not to weak, not too strong) and I would recommend it to coffee drinkers who want a flavor in that range. It is "coffee flavored coffee", in other words, no fancy flavoring. Being organic, it is (hopefully) sans all of the nasty chemicals that tend to get added. I want to note I used it unconventionally. I cut the packets open and ran it through a regular coffee maker. Five packets for a 12 cup pot. Came out just fine doing that. If you're looking for organic coffee, this one will do nicely.<br /><br />My only real issue is the packets do not have an easy open to get the little coffee bag out. I had to use scissors. That might make you mad if you're jonesing for that cup of coffee to wake up in the morning.
1312	5	I bought these as a present for my GF.  Thanks to being Prime eligible, received them in a rather quick manner.  Good Price and the chocolates were delectable.<br /><br />The candy themselves are about BB pellet size, to give you an idea of how big each one is.  The Tin itself is small, small enough to fit in a purse (According to my GF).
1313	5	I have been trying flavors of green tea...I am trying to learn to drink tea rather than other drinks and I have never liked coffee.  I like the Pomegranate green tea for the K-cup machine.  I will definitely re-order.  I took one of the three packs to work for our office (we all bring different flavors and share) and this tea went fast.  I will purchase again.
1314	5	Makes an Excellent Tasty  Loaf of Bread. I tried the receipe on the bag it was very good and I tried my own receipes came out great.
1315	5	This dog food is great, I have a 5 month old boxer who can't get enough of it. This food has made him look very health with a very soft and beautiful colored coat as well.
1316	5	Very nice product.  Taste of each chewy goodness very fresh and natural.  I want more.
1317	3	I have two dogs.  One dog ate all of it, but he even eats durian fruit. The other was very hesitant and didn't finish it. I won't buy this again.
1318	5	My dog is 3 and he has been chewing and licking his paws for as long as I can remember.  Probably half his day was spent chewing and licking.  He has had many steroid shots and has been taking claritin twice a day for several months.  Nothing has worked....I decided to try this dog food before taking him to a specialist and it has been amazing.  He has been eating the salmon and potatoes formula exclusively for about a week and a half and now he is hardly ever licking his paws!!!  Today I even skipped his claritin and he has not licked his paws all day.  No more grains for my dog!
1319	3	I thought the truffle flavor was not strong enough and I wasn't crazy about the flavor of the olive oil itself.  I've had better luck with the Urbani White Truffle Oil.  So far that's my favorite out of the few kinds that I've tried.
1320	4	But don't eat them on their own.  Salt-free beans are like eating balls of paste.  However, when mixed in to a larger concoction, they're perfect.  I usually eat them in a homemade Mexican bowl with brown rice, salsa and diced grilled chicken that I grilled with a pretty heavy coating of a spice rub. Ok, yes, I also put in a little cheese, so sue me.  With that whole mixture, I love it, and get the satisfaction of avoiding the huge amount of sodium in canned beans.
1321	5	I'm not a fan of messy gels, or stopping for PowerAde during a race. When I do my own long runs or if I'm doing a half, mess and inconvenience factor aside I also don't want to consume junk. These are organic and contain honey, and while soft & squishy somehow don't get stuck to each other when shoved in a gel pocket during a run. The taste is so delicious that my son tries to swipe them as well!
1322	5	I am a really big fan of most sports drinks.  I had favored Powerade before I tried Cytomax and now Cytomax is all I take.  I had never tried the Pomegranate Berry flavor before and NOW I am very glad that I did.  Not just for the electrolyte balance and replacement of necessary nutrients but for the taste also. My wife and daughter, that don't usually even like any of the products, LOVE this one.  My wife told me she thought it was blackberry tea which I must admit is what it almost tastes like.<br />Great product!
1323	4	It really is great instant. At very first sip, I thought I detected that "instant" aftertaste, but as I continued, I was more impressed. I drink coffee black, and am pretty particular about my java. I do think this is a great product to take on the road, to work, etc. Could do without the Starbucks priceyness, though.
1324	5	I ordered a number of different K-cups from Amazon and they were all great... we particularly liked this Italian Blend... especially first thing in the morning!  I did a fair bit of browsing online to figure out where I wanted to order my coffee from... Amazon had the cheapest price, the coffee's we wanted and free SS shipping!
1325	5	Xylitol is the best sugar substitute right now. The other artificial things like sucralose (etc) taste weird but xylitol has a clean sugar taste. Also, since I have a very cavity prone kid, it is nice to allow him to  have sweetner in his tea and not worry since xylitol also inhibits the growth of bacteria in the mouth.<br /><br />I have used it in baking as well. Works great.<br /><br />Given the cost of filling a cavity, the extra cost of xylitol is worth it.<br /><br />Oh...and one more thing, it can be diluted and used as a nasal wash for people with sinus problems because it inhibits bacteria growth (in the nose as well as the mouth....it may even be good on wounds for all I know).
1326	5	This is a wonderful product. I have been drinking it since the day I got it. It does help low my blood pressure. Excellent! Just excelent.
1327	5	Got this to take along on backpacking trips with the horses.  It works fine for that purpose, the size is perfect and worked like a charm.  The two horses didn't attempt a getaway, at least.<br /><br />Easy to put up and easy to take down, along with the portability makes this a camping winner!
1328	1	I was so excited to get this toy for my 7 month old yellow lab.  When it arrived I filled it with kibble and soon discovered that this is the worst toy ever. It is loud and dangerous. The jug is a hard plastic that when swung around can easily bruise you and your dog and break everything in the house. In addition, because I have hard wood floors, the loud bang of the hard plastic against the floor was unbearable.  Lastly, in the two days I allowed her to play with it, the rope became frayed and I kept finding pieces of string in her mouth.  I definitely do not recommend this item.
1329	5	I have 2 Labs and they both love these bones!  And, it takes them a long time to eat them - keeps them busy for at least an hour!
1330	5	Great stuff.  My wife loves it.  The price was a bit high but with free shipping it was still a good deal.
1331	4	I ordered this for my brother's 30th Birthday cake and having never used anything like it before I was a bit clumsy with it.  There isn't much, but it goes a long way. It covered the chocolate genache great and it looked very cool-as did my entire kithen for a week because it gets everywhere...proceed with caution in the kitchen.
1332	5	This is the best K-cups I have found.  You don't have to add milk or sugar.  It's all there.  Love it.
1333	3	Most reviewers seem to find this coffee to be the best ever or just horrid. I thought it was just ok. A bit of a bitter aftertaste if you ask me. It's pretty much the same as Coffee People's Jet Fuel and Wake Up Call, I can't tell the three apart. Interestingly, their Donut Shop is fantastic -- if you like Coffee People (and you can't beat the prices here on Amazon), I'd go for that one.
1334	5	Love the full-bodied flavor of this coffee!  I figure if you can see through your coffee at all, it's not strong enough, but then I am prone to that in most things. This coffee is smooth, rich, and ready to rock, which suits me fine first thing in the morning (lark, not owl).
1335	5	I love strong, full bodied quality tea and typically drink assam, irish breakfast or early grey tea, but as the other reviewer noted the price per pound can be discouraging. So I have been searching for a quality full bodied tea that wasn't bitter at a more palatable price point, and this certainly fits the bill. And unlike some other teas where they tend to be better in one form or another, i.e. iced vs. hot, this tea is excellent in both forms. I would certainly recommend this to anyone who prefers that smooth full bodied quality tea that doesn't cost an arm and leg.
1336	5	I don't review much, but I have been buying this brand for my Irish Wolfhound for over 2 years now.  He still loves it and it's good for him.  If you have a large breed dog, this dog food will be a good choice for healthy food.
1337	1	We did not finish this drink.  I drank some, then gave it to my husband, and he would not drink any after one taste.  He thought it tasted a bit like tobacco.  I didn't think it was all that bad but it wasn't anything special and I never finished it - poured it out in the sink.  It is only 100 calories.  The can says "Do not shake" in small letters toward the top which I read after shaking and spurting it open.  It's not rich but at least not over-sweet.  It's just not very special in my opinion.
1338	5	These brownies are absolutely wonderful. My family likes them better than the original Betty Crocker brownies. They are moist and really satisfying to that chocolate craving.
1339	4	****<br />I enjoy bergamot a lot, but this tea was way too fragrant for me; still it was different and enjoyable to try. The bergamot flavor is strong, not subtle, and a bit overwhelming---it's all you can taste.<br /><br />The ingredients of this tea are premium black teas with pure oil of bergamot---that's all.<br /><br />The manufacturer writes: "Oil of bergamot comes from the rind of a citrus fruit which grows very well in the Calabria region of Italy. Pure top quality oil of bergamot is expensive but no blend or man-made flavoring can match the ethereal aroma and finely nuanced flavor of the real thing.<br />Certain Earl Grey fanatics have grown especially fond of the top grade Calabrian oil of bergamot that we use and have asked for more, ..More,... MORE! Thus was born Stash Double Bergamot Earl Grey. In our Double Bergamot Earl Grey tea, the black tea base still serves as a solid foundation for this blend, but the oil of bergamot takes wing and soars to new unprecedented heights. The flavor is quite pronounced but not at all soapy or bitter which would happen with low grade oils. Is the flavor too strong? For a conservative drinker, maybe yes, but more adventurous types really seem to like it."<br /><br />I must not be adventurous enough. I do agree with the manufacturer, though, and it might be the tea for you if you're a huge fan of bergamot and want a lot of it, and I also agree that it tastes pure, not soapy or bitter at all.<br />****
1340	5	Shiba Inu (35lb) and Malamute (80lbs) owner here. I had been shopping for a new dog food since my old Taste of the Wild brand got hit with a recall.  Ideally I try to keep my dogs' food in as close to the dollar:pound ratio, but it's getting harder and harder to find a good premium dog food in that range. At the time of this review, this Merrick product was creeping up on the two-dollar per pound mark, but I decided to give it a try anyway mostly because of a random sampler I was given while at a pet store. I took home the sampler baggie and my dogs went nuts for it. The dogs were currently eating a mix of left-over <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CIP6K">Taste of the Wild Dry Dog Food, Pacific Stream Canine Formula with Smoked Salmon, 30-Pound Bag</a> and its replacement <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00609PJEC">Hi-Tek Naturals Grain Free Lamb Meal and Sweet Potato Formula Dry Dog Food, 30 Pounds</a>. The dogs still loved the Hi-Tek, but if you placed a bowl side-by-side with the new Merrick, the Merrick would be gone first.<br /><br />For those who have tried Merrick in the past and found that their dogs were ambivalent to their flavors, I would highly suggest grabbing a small bag of their new formulation and trying again. My dogs didn't really care for their old gimmicky flavors (turducken, pot pie, etc), but they really loved this new "Classic" variety. As of this review, my dogs have been eating the product for about two weeks. They're both healthy and their ...droppings... are still as solid as with any other premium dog food. DogFoodAdvisor also gave this new formula a five-star rating.<br /><br />Since I can't seem to find the full ingredient list on the Amazon product page, here is the list from Merrick's site:<br /><br />Deboned Chicken, Chicken Meal, Turkey Meal, Brown Rice, Peas, Barley, Sweet Potato, Chicken Fat (preserved with natural mixed tocopherols), Salmon Meal (source of Omega 3 fatty acids), Oats, Natural Chicken Flavor, Carrots, Apples, Blueberries, Organic Alfalfa, Minerals (Salt, Dicalcium Phosphate, Calcium Carbonate, Zinc Amino Acid Complex, Zinc Sulfate, Iron Amino Acid Complex, Manganese Amino Acid Complex, Copper Amino Acid Complex, Potassium Iodide, Cobalt Amino Acid Complex, Sodium Selenite), Vitamins (Choline Chloride, Vitamin E Supplement, Vitamin A Supplement, Vitamin B12 Supplement, d-Calcium Pantothenate, Vitamin D3, Niacin, Riboflavin Supplement, Biotin, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Folic Acid, Thiamine Mononitrate), Yucca Schidigera Extract, Dried Lactobacillus plantarum fermentation product, Dried Lactobacillus casei fermentation product, Dried Enterococcus faecium fermentation product, Dried Lactobacillus acidophilus fermentation product, Rosemary Extract.
1341	5	Better than I could have imagined.  I can close my eyes and feel like I just ate a brownie covered in caramel.
1342	5	My Mom and her co-workers really enjoy the blooming effect from what sounds like a well constructed 'flower' and they say the tea  tastes great.  I've smelled the hint of jasmine from it though I've not tried it yet - I know they love it.  The teapot is a nice piece of hardware as well.  Hardly a uni-tasker.
1343	5	This is good coffee, fresh, came quickly, local stores can't seem to get their pricing in order so I'll buy it online. It's cheaper. will buy again.
1344	5	I use this in soups, main dishes, on baked potatoes, mac and cheese and bread.  Yum.  If I can find a huge bulk size, I'm going to buy it.
1345	5	I think this makes a good chili. It's a little more expensive than just using chili mix and canned tomatoes. But it really is good.
1346	2	The sent wine was a thing of the commercial prices of about 10 dollars, and was a disappointment.<br />Since cheese and wine are sent separately and a transportation cost increases, it may be unavoidable one.<br />Cheese was delicious.
1347	2	The picture on the front of the package is great, it looks wonderful. When I read the ingrediant list, soy ,soy, meal, and lots of vegtables in chemical form, I was surprized.<br />After a few days, my dogs guts were stinking like soy, foul poop.<br />I do feed and still feed Purina One, lamb and rice to my shelties.I have used it as a winter food for over 20 years. In the summer I fed a more hgigh protien food and supplament with real vegtables.<br />Suggest you give this a pass.
1348	5	This is the best tasting of the hordes of noodles I've tried. You name it, I tried it.  I've been eating this particular one for probably about 10 years or so. I once ate this every meal for a whole month. The MSG really gets you after awhile though.
1349	4	OMG!  This oil is waaaay better than I expected.  I used it the wrong way the first time, "Duuuh!"  putting it on top of the popcorn instead of using it as the popping oil (I'd gotten used to using Grapeseed oil).  Anyway, I heard a 'DING' one day and decided to use it as intended and now I'm on medication to ween me off of this stuff CAUSE I'M ADDICTED!!!  ADDICTED I TELL YOU!  This is like 95%-ish like the movie brought crack - I mean popcorn.  and yes, I go to the movies, pick up a big bag of crack -whoops!  I mean popcorn (sorry I get confused) and take it home.  That's how much I love the stuff.  But now! NOW!  Sorry Harkins "You're Fired!"<br /><br />I don't really know if this is so good for the health, so I'll be sure to get my colesterol checked periodically and if I have to go on Pop-alaysis, then so be it!  I'm fat and I'm happy!
1350	1	This product does not taste good. It's awful actually. And when I ate it, it gave me a lot of gas. Save yourself and don't buy it.
1351	5	This is a great item if you like pumpkin seeds. It's also a great buy. If you buy these in the store they can cost up to $2.99 a bag depending on where you get them. They are fresh & they will last up to six Months.
1352	5	When you have that "dog of a lifetime," it's even more important that your special dog get the best of everything. This product ensures that. No ingredients but the best, most healthful. What's not to love?
1353	4	I've tried 2 types of FoodShouldTasteGood chips - the Multigrain and these. I must say, I'm impressed with both. Most snack foods go out of their way to hit you over the head with their flavors. Not so here. The tastes are subtle and interesting. Gourmet snacks, if you like.<br /><br />In character and consistency, I think the best way way to describe these is to say that they are mid way between a regular corn Tortilla chip and a Wheat Thins cracker (though there is, in fact, no wheat in the ingredients). Lightly salted with just a hint of Olive and Garlic. Very tasty and very snack-able.<br /><br />The one-ounce bags, though they may at first glance seem packaging intensive, are a good idea. If you had a big bag of these in front of you, it would take significant will power to stop after just one ounce. The small bags are a crutch for those of us who lack self-control.<br /><br />Another plus: the bag proclaims in bold type, "No Trans Fat, No Cholesterol, No Preservatives, No GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) Ingredients, No Artificial Colors and No Artificial Flavors". 10% of your daily fiber and just 3% of your sodium too! I had them with a cold beer and felt like I was eating an oxymoron.<br /><br />These are a delicious but natural snack. Well worth the 140 calories they cost. But a few words must be devoted to their monetary price. For about 18 bucks you'll get 24 ounces of these - about 75 cents per ounce. Last week, I bought a 17.5 ounce bag of Ruffles for $3.49 - about 20 cents per ounce. That's quite a differential. Whether you're willing to shell out the extra cash for a non-essential snack will depend on your tastes, your priorities and your pocketbook.
1354	5	This product was consistant with what we were able to purchase in Turkey. We use it daily on our salad.
1355	5	We have to feed our cat 3 to 4 pills a day and he is a very picky eater so it's been impossible to get pills into him without a struggle as he won't eat them if they are just disguised in food.<br /><br />These are brilliant, they're soft like plasticene and you just stuff the pill into the pocket, squeeze it closed and voila, instant cat treat - he begs for them now... why on earth nobody stocks them in the UK I will never know.
1356	1	good the first three cookies you eat, then after that your teeth start to hurt. then after that all you can smell and taste if the egg white smell. trader joes carries similar meringues but those are great. these are DISGUSTING. my 5, 7 and 9 year old nieces wouldn't even touch them! we went through a couple containers but since we got a whole case....we just ended up throwing them away. please save your money.
1357	3	Good healthy snack.  Crisp and satisfies a need for something crunchy without added sugar and additives.  I prefer the sweetness and taste of the Fugi Apple crisps.  The granny's are good but would only order more of the fugi ones due to personal preference.  I want to try the mango chips on the next order.
1358	5	I go to my mothers home one day she cooked fried chicken and rice. I taste the chicken, it is good! That was the day I was introduced to Mae Ploy Sweet Chili Sauce. This sauce is Excellent being sweet and mild hot, will not burn your mouth or give heart burn. I will continue to purchase this product chicken, fish, and other foods are more tasteful. Try it because it is Good!
1359	5	These Cinnamon Altoids are hard to find in the stores.  My husband was pleased that I found them on-line!
1360	5	This is a marvelous product. My favorite way to have it is over a block of cream cheese, served as a spread for crackers. I've also tried it on turkey sandwiches and in tuna fish sandwiches, just plain as a dip for bread. It is sweet and fruity, like a raspberry jam but thinner, and is very mild.<br /><br />I don't feel any heat at all when used in combination with other foods. When eaten straight out of the bottle, there is a slight kick. This is not a sauce for those looking for a very hot sauce nor is it for those whose tongue only favors the bland. If you are meat and potatoes, this is not for you. For the majority who are in between folks, I can say this sauce is the hit of every party.
1361	4	Good product.  The salmon tastes natural unlike chicken in pouches that I also tried and taste processed and artificial.  I would certainly buy it again.
1362	5	Hurricane popcorn is the best. The toppings make the popcorn. This time I decided to purchase the toppings only and add it to plain popcorn.  I was not disappointed.  Now that Amazon is handling the purchase I will continue to order the toppings online.
1363	5	Super fast delivery! And amazing packaging! When i opened the box i saw 18 Cob's as promised and i took the first 1 out to try it, and it tasted GREAT! I love these things and i will definitely keep buying from here when i need more! =D REMEMBER TO HEAT THEM UP FOR 10 SECONDS!
1364	5	Everything I have bought from this brand was wonderful : tamari soy sauce, applesauce, crackers, bread, and something else...everything is tasty, organic and has very few ingredients.
1365	5	Simple, easy to follow instructions makes a little over 6 lbs of beautiful marmalade of a rich colour and a fresh citrus taste. It makes a fragrant and mellow marmalade with a crystal clear body and fine tender shred with a aromatic citrus peel bite. It's easier not to scorch when making marmalade using this product than by cooking down raw fruit and grated peel.<br /><br />The product tolerates improvisation well, I've added shredded lemon peel, fresh ginger or finely chopped candied ginger or additional fresh lemon juice, or used demerara or other flavorful sugars as variations and been very happy with the results.<br /><br />You can tailor how firmly you want the jell set by using the cold plate method of testing during cooking. I prefer mine of a softer set but you can continue to cook it following instructions until it's quite firm.<br /><br />Keeps well when packed in sterile jars and processed in boiling water.
1366	5	These are delicious! Discovered them while I was at Starbucks last week...I've tried the Cinnamon Thins and the Sugar Cookies and they're both great! A nice, healthier option even for people without food allergies. Now I'm just waiting for my local grocery stores to get in the game! Would love to be able to purchase these in stores.
1367	4	It's more of a side dish than a main dish. Cook in some chili beans and peppers then it's more of a meal. It also made a very good taco salad. It was also good as burrito filling with some extra cheese. This is a good starting point to let your imagination make good great. The expiration date on mine was good for a year, well into 2008.
1368	5	I had these cookies when I was a child when my Grandma served them with a little tea set for my cousin Fay and me.  You get the idea of what it would be kie to have them now.  Warm memories...and they are delicious too!
1369	4	I love the idea of bacon anything...I bought this for my kids for Christmas and they all got a laugh out of it, but none of them liked the taste. I would still recommend for the novelty, but don't expect that it's gonna taste good.
1370	5	This is the most original root beer I've ever had. It has a kick: one for your head with the guarana (most energy drinks have this) and one for your tongue (it has capsaicin, the part of hot peppers that burn your mouth). This combination sounds weird i with cane sugar, but this is my favorite soda.<br /><br />I find that either people love this or hate it so try it at your grocery store first before you buy a case.
1371	5	My husband and I love, love, love Kind bars!!! They are so tasty and so good for you, it is a win-win!!!
1372	5	This stuff is amazing!  Luscious Chocolate coated flavored almonds.  I can even justify the treat because it is heart healthy (almonds).  Try them, I guarantee that you won't be disappointed.
1373	1	Give Walden Farms credit for making a no-carb sauce. It's just a shame it doesn't taste better. Still, I do buy it on occasion and mix it with other tastier sauces to lower the over all carb content. However, the smoke taste is so overwhelming that more than a proportion of 1:4 leaves only the taste of this product in your mouth. This product cannot begin to compare with the taste of the now-defunct Kraft's low-carb barbecue sauce. Mostly, I make my own low-carb sauce from scratch and then just add a bit of this to get the smoke taste, but too much and even the best batch of homemade sauce is ruined. However, if you are on an extreme low-carb diet (such as Dr. Bernstein's) this may be the only product that fits.
1374	2	I've been on a ginger ale kick lately and switched to diet since every brand of regular ginger ale I can find sweetens their drinks with high fructose corn syrup instead of just regular sugar. Anything made with or from corn makes me ill, so I've been drinking. I've had the diet Canada Dry version, as well as various store brands from Brookshire's, Albertson's, etc. I ran to the grocery store near work today to pick up something and grabbed a six-pack of Vernors as there were no other options for diet ginger ale.<br /><br />The after-taste is almost like saccharine, even though it is sweetened with Aspertame. It is reminiscent of TAB soda. The taste of ginger ale is there, but there is a chemical-esque taste as well - almost soapy.<br /><br />I won't be getting this brand ever again.
1375	4	Only 4 stars because chow mein noodles in a cello bag will never match getting them from a restaurant. These are the next best thing, however. And these are the better wider noodles with good flavor, not the thin hard La Choy type that you usually find in supermarkets.
1376	5	Started ordering this with the subscribe and save option, prices used to be $12.81, then they're $15.73, and now it appears to have went up to $17.
1377	4	These things are amazing.  I wish someone would have invented them years ago.  all you do is slip the dogs medicine into the hole and give them the treat.  My dogs never even notice in there.  We use them daily.
1378	5	Two increasingly finicky cats approved my leap-of-faith purchase of Newman's Own Organics Chicken & Brown Rice Formula by cleaning up their bowls.
1379	5	I got these for xmas and now I have to have more. Very moist anad chewy,better then homemade.
1380	5	Item came within appropriate time frame and was exactly what I expected. Shipping was a little spendy, but not outrageous. Funny to see it come in a flat rate box though after paying that shipping.
1381	1	I've been noticing recently that this and all their chunky soups are becoming more and more watered down.<br /><br />That and the incremental downsizing of their products(as with just about everything else in the grocery store) means I'll be passing their section of the soup aisle. Time to make my own I guess.
1382	5	We raise our own chicken meat and everyone loves to eat this curry chicken once of week.  Easy to make and delicious!  &lt;>&lt;
1383	5	After using Torani Syrup for the lattes made at home, I no longer have to spend $4 for a latte drink. The Torani Vanilla Syrup is the best in the Market!
1384	4	This coffee has a very tropical taste to it, so it's perfect for iced coffee on a hot day.  The flavor is not bad when heated, but it just seems a little odd.<br /><br />You don't usually think of tropical beverages being hot.
1385	5	The flavor of this coffee it so rich I love it. I add whipped cream to top off a great cup of coffee !!
1386	5	I was very happy with my order.  It was carefully packaged, the strawberries were fresh and delicious.  Can't wait for an excuse to order again.
1387	4	The Big Nut Bars are named properly... they are indeed huge! Very filling, and tasty too. I was expecting something like a granola bar, but these are really more like candy bars. Very sweet, chewy, jam-packed with peanuts.
1388	5	Just unbelievably delicious! The finest cuts of beef and pork living up to that old German traditions of perfection, a must try!
1389	5	This is so good and has spoiled me so badly that I am barely able to drink water if it isn't Smart Water.
1390	5	I love these cookies.  I can't eat gluten and they are a healthy treat. Family members who can eat gluten enjoy them also.
1391	5	I love this stuff. I use it for thickening sauces it works well with everything. It fits in with a low carb lifestyle too.
1392	4	the picture looks delisious...i really dont know if i cooked it wrong but it tasted not like i imagined...but it tastes good not great.....its not russian roulette but why not buy it and give it a go...<br /><br />UPDATE....<br /><br />just microwaved it and it tastes great.....buy it..................i just tasted peperoni and cheese..yummy
1393	5	My local grocery store stopped carrying this brand - but it turns out a better deal through Amazon anyway.  This is my AM beverage of choice!
1394	1	At first this didn't taste like anything.  By time I added enough Mio to taste something, I was then disgusted by the flavor.  I like tea, truly I do.  This is not tea.  But I've found a few ways to describe this flavor:<br /><br />Sucking on brown saccharine?<br /><br />Chewing on stale aspirin?<br /><br />Someone dropped a cigarette butt in my water?<br /><br />Sweaty gym socks were wrung out in my glass?<br /><br />Someone left used motor oil on the bottom of my glass?<br /><br />This  drink is a great idea but a terrible rendering of such.  My teenager wanted to try it and I'm tempted to do a science experiment on him.  We call him Big Foot and I'm wondering if it would stop the growth of said feet.  I don't want him to stop growing taller (6'2" now) so I wonder if I sprinkle it directly on his feet, if that would work?  I'll get back to you.<br /><br />I keep trying to figure out how people like this.  I've finally figured it out and I have a message for them:  WATER is not spelled V.O.D.K.A
1395	3	The positives: 100% RDA of vitamin C...no artificial additives...pure fruit juice.<br /><br />The negatives: 140 calories per can...almost $1 per 8 oz...flavor is a fairly sweet strawberry flavor, little hint of the tartness of watermelon that I was hoping for.<br /><br />It might be a good way for some children to get extra vitamin C and calories (some -do- need both). Certainly, I'd prefer it, nutritionally, to soda.<br /><br />Most adults would probably find it too sweet, too high in calories, and too expensive--at least I did. But, added to some on-hand merlot and some oranges and lemons, it -did- make a refreshing sangria....
1396	5	I love to snack and pop chips have allowed me to still get my crunch on at only 100 calories a bag. I've lost 35 pounds making small changes and counting calories and this is one one them.
1397	4	Great bowls, good quality, dishwasher safe, Only complaint is the fact that they came with stickers on them which were difficult to remove. Would recommend investing in "goo gone" before purchasing.
1398	2	I've really liked some of the other Albanese gummi products, but these were a big disappointment, both in looks and taste. You'll have to trust me about the taste - not good. As for the looks, I posted a photo so people can see that they look nothing like the product image. It's not just Amazon's mistake, either; the photo on the Albanese web site shows a much more colorful product. Stick with the bears, I guess.
1399	5	These are great.  Finished the last jar and back for another.  No oil, no sugar, no msg.  Just delicious almonds and salt.
1400	5	When it comes to soup, I'm somewhat finicky. I normally don't care for packaged soups, but Imagine's Garden Tomato soup has won me over. The light sodium is just the right amount. The soup is creamy and tastes fresh and refreshing. What more can you ask for from soup? It's really good.
1401	4	Well, I wasn't bright when I ordered this coffee and for some reason I thought it came in both single servings and pods. I had to tear the pods open and use just the coffee and that way, it is EXCELLENT coffee. Rich and dark, I really like the flavor. My only complaint is, no, they're not easy to open packets, I have to use scissors and really, does it need all that wasteful packaging? But the coffee itself is very good, though I don't know all the fancy words for describing coffee, I like strong flavor with caffeine, usually choosing medium roasts and this fits the bill.
1402	5	Vegan. Natural. Kosher Parve. Made with organic yellow corn; canola, safflower, or sunflower oils [all organic and/or conventional]; and sea salt. Great choice for those who like corn chips like Fr*tos. Great with bean burritos, enchiladas, soups, and even as a crunchy salad topping. Like most chips, highly caloric. 170 calories per 1oz/28g serving. Use as a garnish, repackage in smaller snack bag sizes, or eat in moderation. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews and the vegancompassion Profile for more great choices.

Thank you.
1403	5	If you like Caramels, this is the only PERFECT Caramel IN THE WORLD. Nothing else comes close to comparing. The most expensive and worth every penny.<br />Anything else is a PRACTICAL JOKE - This is Caramel the way it should be. the balance between sweet and salty - hard and soft - is just... simply... PERFECT. It really does not get any better than that - Tasted the original Caramel from Turin, Italy - not even close to the French's Caramel. If you want the best - THIS IS IT !
1404	5	I haven't been to England in half a dozen years. My wife and I used to go every year, but for various reasons, we haven't been in six years. We drink tea there, not so much at home, but we got this tea and it brings back fond memories for me. It's very good tea. I'm not a connoisseur, but I know what I like and I like this tea.
1405	5	Years ago my husband bought a case of this Hot Sauce because of the name.  He would give it as a gift.  I opened a bottle and used it in a few recipes and it is awesome.  I have a special salsa recipe that people ask me for and I tell them this is a must ingredient.  Then when they tell me their's wasn't as good as mine and ask if I gave them the "real" recipe, I asked if they got Scorned Women.  Of course they didn't and it makes all the difference.  It taste like no other Hot Sauce I have had and actually has an great smokey flavor not just hot.  I think I have to hand it out with the recipe, LOL.  A little does go a long way.  I have searched in every grocery store and never find it but was thrilled to find it on Amazon.
1406	4	Recently found this product after finding out I was gluten-intolerant. This is a great way to start if you do like to bake but do not want to take on buying all the ingredients needed to bake gluten-free. The box does not last long but so far this has worked well in all the usual recipes I cooked with when I was using regular flour.
1407	5	I am a major "Chili head", these nutz are amazing. If you are into a burning tongue and runny nose these are for you. If you are only mildly into hot stuff.....Stay away. I burned a couple of folk with these, me personally I eat them by the fistful. The only other nutz close to this is Hottest F@#$IN nuts.
1408	5	All of these flavors are SO good!!! I don't like mint flavored gum and have been using gum to help me smoke/eat less. So, I go through a lot of gum and have tried many different types. The Extra Dessert Delights are the best EVER!
1409	4	I love cooking this in between meals and they are delicious. They are just a little bit too hot for me. Overall I recommend this product.
1410	5	Great product, practically flavorless which is a good thing, mixes great in smoothies and other concoctions. Would def. order again cheaper than in stores.
1411	4	I have actually tried all three new Taco Bell Sauces, the Chipotle which I am reviewing now, and also the Jalape&ntilde;o and the Spicy Ranchero sauces.<br /><br />The Chipotle is my second favorite of the three. (I like the Spicy Ranchero the best). It definitely has a distinct smokey peppery chipotle taste to it, with of course the creamy base.  This sauce goes well on taco salads and (as I used it on) beef burritos.  I suppose you could use it for french fries or tacos as well.  I felt that because the sauce had such a bold flavor that probably its uses would be more limited than the Spicy Ranchero flavor that was much more mild and subdued.  But if you like a bold chipotle flavor I think this would really be for you.<br /><br />The bottles are squeeze bottles but I found that they don't squeeze out easily once you are half way done with the bottle.  You have to store upside down in the fridge or be forced to really shake the bottle to get the sauce to be forced down the the top.  Sauces are thicker than traditional salad dressings.
1412	5	This is one of my favorite k-cup flavors. Have one of them every morning.  Still better than the Starbucks I just tried.
1413	5	An astonishingly delicious soft baked chocolate brownie cookie by Pepperidge Farm, at a great price of only 13.00 for 5 packages that normally go for $3.49 each through Amazon.com seeing it rarely if never goes on sale at the supermarket unlike Pepperidge Farm's Milano Brand Line of cookies and their Goldfish Crackers all of the time. Great purchase at the right price when available! ENJOY!!!
1414	5	Our Dogs love them and with auto-order it was never easier to get dog treats that are healthy at a great price.
1415	5	In my search to find yummy treats for my dog, that don't make him sick, I stumbled upon happy hips, which is perfect since my dog is a lab mix predisposed to hip problems.  He loves them!!  In fact he has gotten to the point where he refuses other dog treats.  I love the fact that these are all natural and my only complaint is that it was a little pricey (over $7 per bag) and a little difficult to find.  Well, amazon took care of that!  They came quickly and were quite a deal.  I will purchase again and again.
1416	5	I tried comparing this initially to bottles that I could get from my local grocery store.  Ends up while it is the same product, it wasn't the same size.  The local grocery store is 2/3rds the size of the bottles provided here, and are made of glass.<br /><br />These are made of plastic, and I get 50% more for the same (or lower) price.<br /><br />I have subscribed for a monthly shipment and it keeps me well supplied for my morning flavored ice coffee (at a fraction of the price I would pay for Starbucks/Petes/Seattle's Best Coffee shop prices.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon!!
1417	3	I've tried some of the other pop chips flavors - and they have MUCH more flavor. My kids, however, absolutely love these and since they're so much healthier than potato chips (I hope) I'll probably just continue ordering them.
1418	4	There are at least two known breeds of Spotted Dick (or Spotted Dog, as it was once called).  The one that was a staple of my childhood (English working class) diet is a steamed suet pudding.  It is made from suet, flour, sugar, currants and raisins, and is usually served with treacle.<br /><br />The Heinz canned version is a very different animal, a member of the sponge pudding race, containing no suet.  It is nice enough, and is especially good with English-style custard.  It is tasty, filling and easy to prepare, and its name makes it great fun.<br /><br />But if you are a fan of the Aubrey/Maturin stories and want to eat like them, be warned that this is not the real thing.  The genuine Spotted Dick (or Dog), described in O'Brian's books, is the glorious suet pudding of my youth.<br />[PeterReeve]
1419	1	I wanted to try different flavors of coffee, and 3/4 of the package was hot chocolate.  I won't order this again.
1420	5	This diet ginger ale syrup mix is great.  As good as any other ginger ale's out there and a much cheaper way to get it.
1421	4	As others have said, "if you like your tea to taste like the smell of a campfire", then this would be the tea for you.  I personally don't like it, but my friend loves it.  He calls it "smokey tea" instead of it's real name.<br />It's one of those things that you either will love it or hate it, there's no in between.  If you liked smokey flavored things, you will probably like this tea.  It does taste better with sugar in it too, kind of "softens" the taste, but make no mistake...IT'S A STRONG FLAVOR!
1422	5	This is really good bread. It is so soft and easy to slice for sandwiches. I love it as toast with a little butter and honey.
1423	5	Very pleased with the hard to find wafers - arrived quickly and very well packed - not a broken one in any of the boxes!!! My family loved the desserts made with them over the holidays and I was completely satisfied with the transaction.
1424	5	Wonderful tea. I think most of the reviewers who hated it already had their own favorite vanilla-nut tea and found this tea different from what they expected?<br /><br />I usually dislike Stash Teas, but this flavor is just so pleasant and homey. Add some sugar and milk and it's a real treat. I agree with the reviewer who found it reminiscent of hot cocoa. It does have a tiny chemical smell, or maybe that's the vanilla. I have a poor sense of smell. It's a very cozy winter tea, but I like it too much to not have it all year 'round.
1425	5	I was looking for an easy, high fiber meal for my husband and I when I found this soup mix.  It takes just 12 minutes to cook (once the water boils) and is so amazing tasty!  I add a handful of ham chunks at the end and a tablespoon of olive oil - it makes two large, dinner-size bowls of soup for us.  Smells amazing - we eat every bite!
1426	4	It's a pretty good sub for the coffee shop version. No mess and the S&S price is great! I like that the box has perforations to remove part of the side so that it functions as a dispenser.
1427	5	Received in a timely manner and in good condition. My Mishka is a little spoiled (I cook her meals when I can afford it, buy her wellness kibble when I can't) but she ate this willingly. I bought this because it qualified for overnight shipping, unlike the much heavier wellness bag, and she was almost out of kibble. I'm happy with the compromise.
1428	5	My German Shepherd has food allergies and cannot eat chicken, rice or carrots. It seems all dog treats have one or more of these ingredients so I was very happy to find Smokehouse brand duck chips. But then the pet store discontinued carrying this item. I called the company and was told I could order on Amazon.com. This is the best way to buy Duck Chips. I don't even have to leave the house, the package is delivered promptly to my door and my dog is very happy. You can trust Smokehouse for quality products and Amazon for quality service.
1429	5	Great texture and balance of sweet to butter is just about right. Adults and kids both love them. Recommended
1430	5	Bob's Red Mill Tapioca, Small Pearl, 24-Ounce Units (Pack of 4) (Purchased on July 2, 2012)<br />This product is quality from the first time you make to the next time it is made<br />all you have to do is follow the easy instructions on the packaging and it will be perfect and the price is the best cost I have had, will buy more in the future.. Carl
1431	1	These wafers taste incredible under normal circumstances but the six tins are a crumbled mess of smashed chocolate sticks. They should have written 'fragile' on the box. It's literally a pile of chocolate goo and crumbs. I will not order again...
1432	4	they are not contained in the keurig plastic cup so once you open the package, you'll want to put them in an airtight storage but i was really impressed with the smooth flavor and good taste. these were a little cheaper than most of the keurig kcups i've found so i was not sure what to expect but these are deff up there on my favorites list.
1433	4	Gift buying is not my forte.  (I'm great with sentimental cards and photo-related presents, but when it comes to shopping, I'm not always earning an A+!)  A tea-loving co-worker found this treat in her Christmas basket and was thrilled.  Delicious candy cane smell (yes, really!) and rich taste we've all come to expect from Celestial Seasonings tea.  Would buy again!  One (small) downside: Many holiday versions of everyday products have a fun festive look.  These are totally standard CS bags, so unless you keep the box out, the Christmas-y nature of the tea isn't obvious.
1434	5	Although pricey, this seems to be an effective dental product if used regularly.  Make sure you have plenty of fresh drinking water available for your dog when using this product.
1435	2	This tea was a disappointment - I love green tea with jasmine, but this tea has artificial flavorings added to it. Don't order it in bulk unless you have tried it before, or you may be stuck with 6 boxes of it like me. I tried to pawn off a box on my sister, but she won't drink it either. :S
1436	5	This is an absolutely lovely tea blend. I drink it with milk and a little splenda, and the taste holds up beautifully. It has quickly become my weekend and special occasion tea, because it costs more than plain old Lipton. I'm thrilled to find it here on Amazon.
1437	5	By mixing this with a little olive oil, and smearing it over the chicken, it provides a spicy, easy to grill (no/low sugar, hence, not blackened) chicken.
1438	5	Just my opinion but these are the greatest with there light taste and crispness. I do reccomend that you request extra packing as these are fragile. There are none better.
1439	2	Coffee is good but most either will not pass the water through or deposit most of the coffee grounds into the cup.  Will not buy again.
1440	3	My dog loves peanut butter, but she really didnt like this particular treat.  I've given her Zuke's beef treats and she liked it very much, so thought would try peanut butter.  She tolerates one a day (I'm giving it to her for the glucomasine part) but thats it.  Will go back to beef after this bag runs out.  Just a heads up!  I still like Zukes' products tho!
1441	5	So far Lola (my dog) absolutely LOVES these...anything with peanut butter is great so naturally these she loves...using them to teach her new tricks by breaking them into 4 squares.
1442	5	My little guy could not live with out these treats, literally. These are one of few treats small enough so that he does not overdo his treats, yet soft enough to hide his pills in so that he takes his medicine without a fight.
1443	5	My dogs love these treats. All three of my dogs ate them and wanted more. Very healthy treat for dogs, would recommend.
1444	5	I find these a little stinkier than most treats.  This is probably why my dog suddenly turns into the most obedient dog on the Pacific coast any time these are near.  I've used freeze dried liver, hot dogs, corn dogs, hamburger, lots of other things and these seem to be my dogs favorites.
1445	2	I had a really hard time drinking this product. I tried it cold and room temperature. Nothing helped. However 2 of my co-workers loved it. It smells like fresh cucumbers (I do like the vegetable) however to sip it,  the taste is well....it is a liquid light tasting cucumber, thus the name "Hint". I did give mine away.
1446	5	This cereal has a great cinnamon flavor, and isn't as sweet as I suspected it might be considering it is 'cinnamon roll' flavor and not just cinnamon. In fact I would even say that it isn't as sweet as Cinnamon Toast Crunch, and not as over-powering either. I love the texture of the mini-wheats and so this makes for a great combination. With it being part of the 'little bites' brand the pieces are very small, great for kids, but still a good cereal for adults too! An adult could definitely eat this cereal without feeling as though they're eating a blatant kid's cereal (no outrageously bright colors or noxious fruit smells). A great cereal for all the family.
1447	5	It wasn't until I bought a bag of these when I finally learned what good potato chips taste like. It's sort of like the epiphany you have when you think American cheese is the best cheese you've ever had until you actually try smoked gouda. I know that sounds like an overstatement, but that's how good Herr's Heinz-flavored ketchup chips are. Once you try these, all of your previous favorites will start to pale in comparison.<br /><br />"What's so darned great about them?" you are probably wondering. What's gotten everyone in such a tizzy? Why the rave reviews and the almost cult-like devotion to these chips? It's not just because they taste good. It's because Herr's is one of the few snack makers that bucks that shady practice so many of them engage in now, especially Pringles. You know what I mean-- that cute, little trick of advertising their chips as literally bursting with flavor, when in reality the chips are so lightly dusted that there's barely any flavor to them. Herr's philosophy in terms of chip-to-flavor ratio couldn't be more different. Open any one of their snacks-- especially this one-- and the chips are so covered in powder that it's impossible to not have it cake up on your finger tips without constantly cleaning them. These Heinz ketchup flavored chips are so heavily dusted, in fact, that you'll wind up with red-stained fingers for a few hours after gorging on them. It makes for a messy experience but in the end, getting a moutful of flavor with each bite makes the hassle of cleaning up all worthwhile!<br /><br />Sure, this excessive powder doesn't exactly make Herr's the healthiest of snack choices, but what snack is? It's all gonna kill us, anyway, so really-- all this really comes down to is choosing our poison. My poison happens to be these chips, and will most likely be yours once you taste them and subsequently become hopelessly addicted like me.
1448	1	Tasted like it was very old.<br />When I get home I will check to see if there was a "use by date".<br /><br />I will return since it was a 12.5 pound bag ... or I may use as bird seed etc.<br /><br />When I came back online to write this review, I see the message to signup when this product becomes available again.<br /><br />This suggest that yes I got the last bag and it was very old.<br /><br />UPDATE the next day ...<br />The popcorn bag had an "use by date" MAY 2012<br />That is four months from now.<br />I'm not sure, but I read somewhere (could be wrong here) that the window on popcorn kernels is 3 years from date of packaged. Feel free to correct this if you know this is incorrect.<br /><br />Amazon will refund and emailed shipping label for return. (Thanks Amazon)
1449	5	This is a great product.  The entire family absolutely love it. Great snack for school and work.  In fact, we are all addicted to it and this item is on the subscription list.
1450	4	This is like a better version of raisin bran. It tastes better and is better for you! It is the perfect snack or breakfast.
1451	1	I really like other flavors of Stash (peach, lemongrass green and breakfast blend).  But, this has two types of cloves which I knew weren't my favorite but it also had cardomon oil which is my favorite spice.  But the cloves overpower everything else.  Numi golden chai has no cloves whatsoever so I recommend it if you want to avoid those pesky cloves.  Oh, Numi also does not have black pepper which is traditional in chai tea but is also a taste I don't like in my tea.
1452	5	This is my favorite cereal.  It's healthier than sugar cereals.  It is a great source of fiber.  The raisins are a lot better than those in regular Raisin Bran.  The clusters are sweet and delicious.  Even my toddler (who is a picky eater) likes this.  At Amazon.com's subscribe & save price - it's an amazing value.
1453	5	Bob's Red Mill All purpose flour is a great substitute for wheat based all purpose flours!  My daughter and I recently began a gluten free diet, and the other family members love our baked goods...say they're better than the "old recipes!"  I was concerned about the price of the flour and mixes at the grocery store, came to Amazon and found out the best way to buy is on auto delivery!  Now I pay less than half of what the cheapest grocery price was!  Thanks Amazon!
1454	5	If you like the soft type of gummy bears rather than the more chewy kind (like Haribo), you will love these.  They have a wide variety of flavors that really taste different, unlike some generic brand gummy bears that have different colors, but taste very similar.  These favorably compare to the old Amazin Fruit gummy bears that used to be popular.  If you are a single person, I would not get these for yourself, because you will get sick eating them (it is difficult to stop).  But if you have a family or a group of friends or coworkers to share these with, this is a great deal!<br /><br />These bears are delicious!
1455	4	Product was excellent really seemd to help my dog, however the price was very high for the little amount received. I found a much bigger bag locally at a better rate. Would buy again though!
1456	5	This is a bargain compared to other K-cups.  This cup is a little different but still works and uses less plastic which is better for our environment.  The K-cups come in 3 plastic, sealed packs with 12 in each pack so they will stay fresh.  The coffee is very good tasting.  Put this on a subscribe 'n ship subscription and can change the shipping whenever I want.  Love that it is decaffeinated.
1457	5	Looking forward to using this in my next turkey.  Thanksgiving was delayed this year.  I'll cook a turkey this winter for my friends.
1458	5	I would always go to Starbucks whenever I was in the mood for peppermint hot cocoa because I didn't know of any brands that sold individual packages of it. Then I discovered Stephen's.. I can honestly say that I will never have to go back to Starbucks again when I'm craving hot cocoa. This is the best hot cocoa I have ever tasted in my entire life, it really does taste like Christmas in a cup!!
1459	5	I prefer my coffee to be a bold Flavorful roast and this Tully's French Roast does that, and then some. I've tasted a number of different K-Cups and Tully's seems to satisfy the boldest tastes, their coffees always seem to be a little bit of heven.
1460	1	I should have heeded the other reviewers who noted that this product was stale on arrival. Same thing happened to me. Amazon was quick to remedy the problem, as it always is.<br /><br />But, stay away from this product. The package had no expiration date so there is no telling how old it is. And whole wheat products tend to go stale more quickly.
1461	3	The switch brand Sparkling Juie consists of 2 main Ingredients<br /><br />A. Carbonated Water<br />B. fruit juice concentrate<br /><br />While I was pleased with it's flavor (This review is about the Black Cherry Flavor), it however wasn't that sparkling/carbonated. When I opened the can, I was expecting it to fizz like a can of soda does.<br /><br />It's got a great taste but let's face it, it's prettty much like stirring a packet of Black Cherry Kool Aid into 64 ounces of Tree Top Apple Juice.<br /><br />For A carbonated beverage, it should be more carbonated
1462	5	With full disclosure, I work for a non-profit partner of Tevolution. This being said, I believe strongly in embracing a product and supporting with a whole-heart!The amazon.com purchase process was smooth, stream-line and the Tevolution arrived safe in sound in a timely fashion! I am ready to twist. sip. give. Thank you to Amazon for hosting this product on your site and thank you to Tevolution for a tasty and worthy product!
1463	5	My sister gave me some of this product and for the past year I have been looking for it. Finally looked on Amazon and there it was.
1464	5	Really loved these!! I have 4 small kids and they were so happy to eat these and they taste great for them!! We put craisins in them,,, yummy!!
1465	4	I would have given this a higher rating but I lost my appetite while waiting for the crackers to get to me. I'm not sure what the hold up was but it took almost 3 weeks for me to get them. This is a good product but the glitch between the manufacture and the distributor needs to be addressed.
1466	5	I purchased this as a gift for the holidays.  Our friends opened the cheese and shared with all of us...It was delicious.
1467	5	Got a case of this for $9 with free shipping!! At the local pet store (petco) its at least $2 per can on sale! I am about to head back to college so stocking up for my pup now with good healthy dog food is GREAT at this price!
1468	5	I bought this chocolate so I could dip fruit in it for my husband (who's diabetic).  This is the best sugar-free dark chocolate for melting that I've found.  I plan to stock up on it!
1469	5	This is the best Genmai-cha in tea bag form. I've turned all my friends on to it. It has the same flavorful taste as when brewing from fresh leaves.
1470	5	these are the best cookies in the universe, and i wish i was a little less heavy so i could at least rolls over in bed and grab a fresh bag<br /><br />my mom has not been home in four hours, where is she<br /><br />my cookies i need my cookies
1471	5	Red Pepper relish has been a staple and in our home for many many years. It is awesome. Now my grandson makes it a must for one of his choices on the refrigerator shelf.<br /><br />Oh so delicious!!!!!!!!!!
1472	5	very happy with it. My husband and I use herbs from it frequently. It produces so much we have had to trim and freeze some of the leaves for later use.
1473	5	These cookies are wonderful.They are thin, delicate, and have a buttery, slightly cinnamom taste. There was a Potato Chip Commercial out years ago, which simpy stated " I bet you can not eat just one... " This reference may also be made to these cookies. They are so good!<br /><br />We purchased 2 cases, to give for a nice little Holiday Gifts. My Mother is 82, she has always baked cookies for our family, she praised them highly as well.<br /><br />For those into making Gift Baskets, these would be a nice addition.<br /><br />The price on Amazon was less than in the local Grocery Store. The Free Shipping, was also great.
1474	5	These chips are thick and crunchy.  I absolutely love them.  The taste is perfect.  I like to buy these smaller bags because I cant trust myself with a large bag of these because they taste no good.
1475	5	This is much stronger than the Carabou or the original Lake and Lodge coffee. Not for the faint of heart. But it is tasty, without bitterness.
1476	5	Perfect year round with just about any meat dish, these Omaha Steaks Twice Baked Potatoes are a gourmet delight. The consistency of the whipped potatoes is smooth and the little bits of bacon, peppers and cheese add to the explosion of flavor.  They cook easily in either the conventional oven, or on the grill when wrapped in foil!  Go ahead, treat yourself!
1477	5	This is a two part review.  First, for those who don't usually take in spicy foods, and then for the enthusiasts.<br /><br />Those who don't regularly consume and/or enjoy hot/spicy foods, I don't know why, except to perhaps experience anaphylactic shock, you would use this sauce.  Some may use it as a terrible prank, or for less evil-minded people, perhaps to add just a tiny drop to a huge pot of chili to spicen things up.  I would warn you to be extremely careful with this.  Nothing but holding cold milk in your mouth for several minutes will get rid of your world of pain.  You may also experience breathing difficulties, and I'm not trying to kid or scare you, just warn you of the realities.<br /><br />For those who love hot sauces, you'll note something very interesting, as you may have noticed with all the previous sauces before.  First you'll be shocked by how little of this sauce is required to produce a lot of heat.  But rather quickly, the heat will disappear, and you'll be filled with massive cravings for the endorphin rush produced by putting a lot on a little.  I swear, I'm salivating for that sauce right now as I write, and I smear this stuff on like ketchup; and those of you who experience no pain with very hot foods know exactly what I'm talking about.  A fair warning is necessary however, that this sauce, while it may produce an extremely pleasant sensation for the "connoisseur", will nevertheless peel the skin off your hard palate if you use too much, or for too long/often.<br /><br />My quest continues for a sauce that will be so painful that my nervous system will be unable to compensate for it.  Any recommendations are welcome.
1478	5	I've ordered from this company a few times.  If I remember correctly the orders were for dates and various types of nuts.  All ingredients have been fresh and tasty.  Highly recommend their Brazil nuts, sesame seeds, almonds, and dates.  Enjoy!
1479	5	I want to personally thank the one who invented the Pill Pockets.  As my dog got older, I was given the position of giving her pills for different ailments so that she may have a good quality of life...I have wrapped them in cheese, bologna, shaved turkey...but when I found these pill pockets and in flavors, well!...  She takes them as treats.  Her favorite is the chicken flavor.  If I take too long getting her pills in them, she paws at the bag, or even once grabbed the bag with her teeth!...and delivered right to the home!
1480	5	This product along with fennel tea and peppermint capsules from heather stopped the nausea that the Drs couldn't!!!<br />Thank you soooooo much Heather for phenomenal products.
1481	5	I've suffered through having to always go get coffee out as my other half likes/needs the lower strength Donut Shop mild stuff, and I finally broke down and got me a case of 50 of these WONDEFUL Green Mountain Dark Magic K-cups.  THEY ARE PERFECT for someone that likes a strong, bold, delicious cup of coffee (and not that mild brown water some others drink)!  If I could afford espresso all the time, I'd do that, but this is a very close second and the taste is consistent.  Not one ground has come through into the cup (whereas other k-cups do).  This is some good, bold, flavorful coffee!
1482	5	This tea actually has a soothing, relaxing effect that is noticeable. It's like a mild sedative--very mild. Its affects last perhaps a half an hour. But if you want something to help you relax and get in the mood for a good night's sleep, it's just right. Also, this tea tastes fantastic. Even though it has valerian root in it, which in capsule form smells light rotting gym socks, the tea has this minty, herby, sweet aftertaste that makes it good all by itself, even aside from the relaxing affects.
1483	5	This was my 1st attempt to get off artificial sweeteners. I liked it! It takes as much as sweet n'low for each cup of coffee/tea(3 packs)..I should say it takes a little getting used to, it is less sweet that sweet n low(since natural sweet is less sweet anyhow) but you get used to it quite fast! and there's no aftertaste or anything like it. If you looking for something natural & with zero calories then you should give it a taste.
1484	3	Pretty much what you taste is...salty brothiness. But there is white meat chicken and a decent amount of both carrots and rice. I find this soup is helpful as a hunger stopgap when I'm trying to cut my calories. It's not  hugely flavorful, but it's hot and has few calories and little fat, so it's okay.<br /><br />I also think it's fine with a sandwich for a soup-n-sandwich type lunch on those days when I'm sick of a tomato-based soup (which tend to be more flavorful, frankly).<br /><br />Here are the nutritionals:<br /> Calories  120<br />Total Fat  2g<br />Sat. Fat  0.5g<br />Trans Fat  0g<br />Polyunsat. Fat  0.5g<br />Monounsat. Fat  1g<br />Cholesterol  15mg<br />Sodium  480mg<br />Potassium  720mg<br />Total Carb.  19g<br />Dietary Fiber  1g<br />Sugars  2g<br />Protein  7g<br /><br />If you don't like a salty taste, this is not for you. Despite lower salt content than regular Campbell's, it still tastes hugely salty to me.<br /><br />I think of it as a soupy tool to manage my crazy appetite. Some days. :)<br /><br />Enjoy.
1485	5	I love these bags. They're easy to store in a drawer or in the car. I coud easily put several in my pocket or attach to the leash with a rubber band. Highly recommend these easy to use biodegradeable bags!
1486	3	I bought this product (Beef Flavor) to be able to maybe give my dog her medicine more easily, but she won't eat them.  She puts it in her mouth, but then spits it right back out, licks it a little, then leaves it alone.<br /><br />I've tried breaking it into smaller pieces (she is a small dog), but she still won't eat it.<br /><br />This is a dog that LOVES treats and this is the only "treat" I cannot get her to eat.<br /><br />It's a good concept, but you may be wasting your money as I did.
1487	5	I have used this product for a couple year now and love it.  In fact, instead of mixing it with water, I mix it with my coffee in the morning and enjoy it more then the mocha's I was getting at well-known coffee places. I used to by this product at a couple stores who longer carry it, which was really frustrating. Being able to buy it online is great!
1488	4	Crispy, light, but overloaded with sugar.Sweeter then any GF product I have tried!!!  The price is one the high side, but Amazon has a good deal.
1489	4	popcorn is very good. but only makes about half of it.tast so good like moive theater popcorn.so so so goooooooooooooooooood
1490	5	I'm not sure why the previous reviewer found all of hers to be burnt.  I've been buying these for awhile, and while the duck portion is dark--as expected with duck wrapping, it has never looked burnt and has always been eagerly accepted by our dogs.  This is a very healthy treat, as well.
1491	5	they are fabulous and not bad for you, what else could you ask for!
1492	1	From the looks of the package this saffron is exposed to light. The reason some views say that this saffron is weak is because some of the important chemicals involved in the aroma and flavor of saffron break down relatively fast in the presence of light. As such you'll notice high quality brands use opaque packaging, i would avoid this one if you're looking for quality.
1493	2	I picked up a can of these after the glowing reviews I read for it. To keep it short, it has a very authentic wasabi taste. It literally tastes like an almond dipped in wasabi sauce. And that, to me, doesn't make the most appealing snack. I find the wasabi flavor overwhelming, and none of the soy flavor coming through. I thought it'd come through as a more balanced flavor, but that's not the case. I won't be eating anymore, personally. I gave it two stars since it is wasabi flavor, and it certainly tastes like that.
1494	5	My four beagles love these for the taste and I love them for the fact that there is no grain product in them.
1495	5	I just love Maypo!  I live in York SC, and they do not sell Maypo here, I always have to wait until I go to New Jersey, where I am from, to buy it or my niece would send me some.  I don't have to wait anymore, I can just order it from amazon.com!!!!  I LOVE IT!!!  Did'nt have to wait long for it either!!  Amazon.com I love you!!!!  Thanks!!!!<br /><br />Pam
1496	5	I love these pringles. they are so good. I alway have to buy at least 4 cans at a time, because one can only last 2 day at the most. If fact i'm eating them right now as i write this review.
1497	5	Very satisfied with product.  Shipping was fast.  Product arrived sooner than expected.  Will purchase from Barry's Farm again.
1498	5	Both of my dogs love these antlers and they are much cheaper than other antlers available through amazon.  My doggies love that they can easily get to the marrow, but perhaps because of this, these don't last as other antlers.  On the other hand these hold the dogs attention longer than other antlers.  I am extremely happy with this product and will continue to order them.
1499	5	German Haribo's are the best but the Hungarian one's are just as good as the German ones.  If your ever in Germany, visit an ALDI or PLUS supermarket and purchase these Haribos at 300g for 85 cents EUROs. And if your in Bonn, Germany go to the Haribo plant where it all started!!! Otherwise, Amazon has the best price when you choose the free shipping after $25.
1500	5	This is the best way to give our dogs pills! We've tried other methods to get our dogs to take their medicine without success. The Pill Pockets and pills disappear instantly! Our seven-year-old arthritic cocker spaniel would find the pill in a piece of hot dog or hamburger and spit it out every time but with the Pill Pockets, she gulps it down! She can't wait to get her 'morning treat' every day!! Great product!!
1501	3	Of the Mio flavors, I found the tea to be the least satisfying, but a bit of lemon or mint wakes it up just fine. It's still a simple, mess-free way to fix something without calories or caffeine. I just leave the little squeeze bottle in the front of the pantry and use it whenever I want something besides water to drink.
1502	4	I wanted to look up cream of rice to see how it is produced and I found this site on Amazon, where they appear to sell this kind of product.  I was surprised since I thought they were only into books and music.  I was further surprised to hear that so many people were having a hard time finding it and that it cost nearly five bucks a box to get it online.  I buy it all the time from Cub and eat nearly a box at a time.  It cost less than three dollars a box here in MN. I adorn the cooked rice with a tablespoon of butter and about a quarter cup of heavy whipping cream and another of white sugar.  I intentionally make it very thick and lumpy so the cream makes it like a thickened stew and the lumps are like dumplings.  People think it sounds awful until they take a taste of mine and they rarely go back to the former slurry they thought they liked until they tried mine.
1503	4	I received these cookies as a sample to try out and I would have to say that I would consider these for purchase.  The cookies are billed as "gooey" cookies.  They aren't the most gooey inside cookies.  I would say that each cookie is bigger than a quarter but smaller than a silver dollar.  Somehow I remember ChipsAhoy from my youth being bigger.  No matter, the cookies are still delicious.<br /><br />After I sampled the cookies, I put them out in the office breakroom and gave them a test.  Anything that lasts in the breakroom until noon is not that great.  These cookies didn't make in until 10am.  My co-workers loved them.<br /><br />I checked to see if there were any transfats in these cookies and didn't see any hydrogenated fats.  I might have missed something but it looks like they are transfat free.  Maybe I'd have to re-read the packaging but they looked solid.
1504	5	This is a great Green Tea for the price I have used this Gunpowder Tea for 3 years now and the quality has always stayed the same, the best results I get is when I used a French Press Machine, this is mostly used for coffee, but great for tea as well, what is really cool is that Amazon offers automatic re orders, meaning they will ship me a bag of the Green Tea once a month at a discounted price, this is wonderfull, what a GREAT SERVICE!!, so I wont forget too,have a good one
1505	5	My husband loves this coffee,he say's "it just tastes good",and he is one that likes the stronger brand. I have drunk a cup or two also but I always use flavored cream usually around the holidays. But you can't go wrong with Caribou.
1506	5	We love this product!  We use it to make our own chile powder.  Very high quality and consistent in flavor.  Highly recommended.
1507	5	Celestial Seasonings India Spice Chai Tea K-Cup 48 Count Case ...<br />Great product fast service will definately buy this product again ;&lt;)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004GIE562">Celestial Seasonings India Spice Chai Tea K-Cup 48 Count Case</a>
1508	5	Hershey's 5th Avenue is one of the best candy bars I have ever had the pleasure of ingesting...<br /><br />It's a perfect blend of chocolate, with crunchy peanut that reminds me slightly of a Chick-O-Stick, and also reminiscent of a Reesesticks...<br /><br />I hadn't had one in a long time, and a co-worker had shown me a box of these, and sold me a box of 36 bars for $4.00 at my work!  Amazing price, and a great candy bar.
1509	1	It has been over three weeks and I still have not received this product.  And, they have charged me for it already...
1510	5	These were exactly what I was looking for, and my dog loves them.  He eagerly takes his capsules when they are hidden in one of these.  I occasionally give them as a special treat, as well.  I highly recommend them.
1511	3	I really wanted to like this product.  I though it might be a nice alternative to the iced-coffee I drink during the summer; and I REALLY liked the idea that it had vitamins.<br /><br />LIKES<br />--Two squirts in a cup of cold water produced a refreshing drink.  It tasted 'fruit punchy' and crisp.<br />--Bottle was easy to use and didn't leak.<br /><br />DISLIKES<br />--After five minutes I suddenly discovered an after-taste that persisted for more than fifteen minutes.  Meh.<br /><br />WISHFUL THINKING<br />--Wish they had used another sweetner.<br />--Wish they'd come out with a kid's version without caffeine.<br /><br />Conclusion<br />I think this product is well priced.  I think the initial flavor is really nice, but the after taste popped up after awhile which sort of detracted from the overall experience.  You might try this in iced tea.<br /><br />Pam T~
1512	5	I have a German Breed, G.Sheph. & he is VERY, VERY, PICKY! He loved them. He is such a happy camper. He wakes up in the morning & ready to go for his walks & comes home straight to his treat cabinet, he wants his chicken stix....thank you, finally something that my boy loves....
1513	3	It does what it is supposed to, but I was expecting to get a lot more than we did.  I think I will try and make my own in the future.
1514	5	Yum Yum - this stuff is good!  Perfect for adding to protein shakes or greek yougart or just add water for a delicious dip for apples and celery. You can use it as a dry dip for banannas too!  Has made a wonderful addition to my meals and helps keep me on track with my reduced calorie diet.  I love peanut butter but don't miss (or the higher calories) with PB2.
1515	5	Very good product  a little bit on the brown side compare to the picture .. And like the other reviewer has some stems but all in all good quality and generous portion......  The tea is very good. For female health.  I use a French pressor comes out really nice
1516	3	I was fooled, the previous product features of this product said that I was suppose to receive 6 boxes of tea at 108 each box, total 648. I was really excited because I love tea and was thinking ...wow what a great deal!! To my surprise I only received 1 gift set box of 6 teas, total 108 and to my suprise they also changed the product features to read the correct thing. I WAS FOOLED AND AM VERY DISAPPOINTED.
1517	4	...and mustardy, I like mine on French bread with a big slice of provolone then pop it in the toaster oven. Oh boy, Mister Mustard is right!
1518	4	Which isn't wholly positive for me, because I've never been the biggest fan of Blue Sky sodas. "So why did you buy this product," you may ask. My answer: 1. It's mega-cheap compared to a case of Zevia. 2. I was curious about how Stevia would change the Blue Sky flavor.  The answer to that question is "not much," which is a good thing for Blue Sky fans.  I like Zevia better, but this is quite drinkable, especially when it's ice-cold.
1519	3	I was looking for something that tasted similar to the restaurants that I love to frequent, but are expensive.  I think the seasoning blend is different than what most restaurants here in Connecticut/Northeast use because this had a foreign taste to me that I did not like. I consider myself to be a very "open" eater and will try lots of tastes but this one just didn't do it for us.  It was very easy to make following the directions, but again just not my thing.  Gave it three stars because it was easy to make.
1520	5	These coconut bars ares so delicious, soft and moist. Fantastic product and very good for you. I love these for breakfast along with my protein shake (-;
1521	5	I am not easy to please when it comes to rice, but this stuff is fantastic. The bowls are just right for adding some edaname or chicken to, maybe a dash of chili and wham! my lunch is the envy of everyone at work. Rice is nice and moist, not crunchy or dry at all-- mmm, mmm! The size is probably enough to serve 2 "average" individuals, but hubby and I eat a lot more than the average person (gym people), so this size is perfect as a side dish. I like that the flavor is very mellow, so you can mix it with just about anything (sometimes tofu, sometimes spicy chicken, sometimes organic black beans, sometimes I stir in some organic butternut squash soup).
1522	2	I have been Gluten free for about 2 years so I have tried many different brands of gluten free pasta,<br />I won't buy this again, falls apart easier than the other brands I have tried.
1523	4	This is a good non-gluten noodle. It held up well in cooking and can certainly substitute for wheat noodles for those who must, or simply want to, use something with no gluten in it. The noodles have no flavor of their own; none. They take on the taste of what they are cooked with. The package is also generous in quantity despite the 7 oz weight. I was cooking only for myself to test trial this for Amazon so I simply broke off a handful. One package would make me many lunches. I had it with stir fried bok choi and spinach and mushrooms with curry  but it would easily also go in an Italian direction. All in all, a good product that does what it says it does. But it does not substitute for the flavor of traditional wheat noodles. There is just no flavor of its own at all. That is why I gave it 4 stars rather than 5. Aside from that it is an excellent product.
1524	4	It says don't give it to dogs that have permanent teeth. My Schipperke has not suffered any dental damage, and loves chewing on it instead of sheets or pillowcases, shoes etc. Loves the chicken flavor, and it lasts a few months. I can say it's a good substitute for houshold goods.
1525	3	I'm a big fan of the Idahoan instant mashed potatoes in all the various flavors and have rated them highly here on Amazon.  However, the "Loaded Baked" flavor was my least favorite of the bunch.  I couldn't really identify a particular flavor with the potatoes.  They were supposed to taste like a baked potato with sour cream, cheese, bacon and chives, but I really couldn't identify any of those flavors when I was eating them.  It was the artificial bacon bits that I found least appetizing.  After the addition of boiling water, the soy protein masquerading as bacon turned into pinkish little chewy bits and the texture and taste I found disagreeable.  I won't be ordering this flavor again.
1526	2	I have purchased K-Cups of Tully's Coffee previously but not the Breakfast Blend. For some reason almost all of the K-Cups in this Pack of 2 purchase I made have had grounds coming out in my coffee mug! I notice that when the cups are pierced the seal is not tight enough to prevent an opening at the rim, thus the fine coffee dust and also some grounds are escaping. Not very happy with this so I am not sure I will buy any more of this particular brand.
1527	4	I buy this product for my son who is on a low wheat diet.  It's pretty good but as others have noted you must cook the rice pasta longer than the box indicates for it to be edible (especially for a child).  After the pasta is cooked I prepare it just like you would prepare the typical box mix (add the butter/margarine back to the pan with the hot pasta, then add in a small amount of milk to get the correct consistency).  If you have an extra minute or two, it is also better to heat up the mixture in the cooking pot/pan.  This blends everything together really well.  My opinion is that it is not good at all if you follow their preparation directions (my son has rejected it several times when prepared by their directions).
1528	1	This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.
1529	5	Like many others here I too was upset and cancelled when they upped the price and cut down the portion, but they did lower down the price. I ordered nine more boxes for $29.92 plus free shipping which is a bargain. The cheapest I could find this cereal local was $4.59 a box. I saved over eleven bucks plus gas. This is the best tasting low calorie cereal and for a real treat add some fresh sliced strawberries...delicious!
1530	4	Delivery was great!  The only draw back is the entire 10 pounds of soba is not individually packaged in any way...a little difficult for a home kitchen. Otherwise, the soba is very good.
1531	3	I love hot beverages now that I have my water cooler with hot/cold water in an instant.  So great to just push a lever and have a hot beverage.  This sounded great, shipped quickly but I found out it is not mixed with water.  Directions state to mix with milk.  I realized after adding water so I added some fat free half and half.  It was very sweet.  Taste was ok.  I'll try it in coffee and by heating milk in the microwave.
1532	5	I just love this product.  It is the only way I will drink a bottle of water.  Simple to use-you can take it with you anywhere to flavor up that dull bottle of water.  Great deal for the money too.
1533	5	We just recently added a corgi to our family, and I started researching different types of wet and dry foods for our pup. After trying different raw diets, we eventually settled on the Weruva brand of dog food. Our local pet store recommended it to us, and the girl working actually opened up a can and started eating it! It's processed in Thailand, and before that scares anybody, you have to realize that the food processing laws in Thailand are MUCH more strict than in America (read it up online!). They are not allowed to process by-product in their pet food, or use filler product. Weruva definitely does not have any of that--you can actually eat the dog food and it'll taste just like dinner.<br /><br />Our boy has a sensitive stomach and he's a very picky eater. The first night we got him the regular Chicken with Gravy he ate that whole can up. He loved it, and when we tried feeding him anything different he refused. Then we ordered him the Kobe Master flavor and it quickly became one of his favorites. I'd definitely recommend this brand, especially coming from a very concerned dog owner. I won't feed my dog anything else.
1534	5	This wonderful candy was included in a huge gift basket that my sister received from one of her students.  She wanted us all to take an item or two.  I chose this, and --oooo-  had to figure out how to get more.  They could very easily be addictive!  I have tasted a lot of caramels over the years, but the texture and taste puts them in another category!  I will be making gifts of these in the future.  They are exquisite!
1535	3	All this hype about this stuff and it hardly did anything for me. The best one for me is AMP but I guess every one is different.  What works for one may not work for another.  It's best to experiment with different drinks until you find the one that does the job.
1536	5	I have a miniature Australian Shepherd who has allergies, and a sensitive stomach. We tried many foods for her before we got Acana, and we haven't left since. She no longer gets an upset tummy after eating, and she has normal digestion with no issues. Acana is a higher protein dog food without all of the soy, corn, and meat "byproducts" most mass produced foods have. This food is more expensive than some foods out there, but it's worth it to keep our little lady healthy and happy. The lamb and apple flavor is her favorite ever, and it has nothing but great ingredients. There isn't anything on the label that is unidentifiable or questionable. Definitely worth the price!
1537	5	This is one of my favorite teas.  The peach is tasty, but not overbearing like many fruity teas and the ginger is mild.  It's a lovely way to start the day--and if you are familiar with the Tao of Tea brand, you already know what a great deal this is!
1538	4	My background in coffee has range ... I can drink the strongest Starbucks coffee or the weaker store bought varieties ... but one thing is for sure, I like my coffee.<br /><br />When I ordered this coffee, I gathered from the current reviews that it was going to be very flavorful and aromatic. This was indeed the case ... it smells and tastes like its namesake. But as with most flavored coffees, it may bore you after awhile (especially since you get a huge amount ... 32 ounces!).<br /><br />I've found that mixing three parts of your more straightforward coffee with one part Cameron's Chocolate Caramel Brownie coffee adds a hint of that amazing flavor without overwhelming your taste buds. Try your own mixture to find that perfect match!
1539	5	Ican't keep my hands off these things.  Got a pack at work.  Got a pack in the bedroom. Got a pack in the living room.  I eat them with soup, or just as a snack. Mmmmm.
1540	4	The product is great. The shipping cost however is a joke. The cost of shipping shioluld be to get the product from the seller to you the buyer. It should not be a source of additional profit to the seller which it clearly is in the case of this item and this seller.
1541	5	After years of using Amazon, this is my very first review! (Sorry for being such a slacker).<br /><br />A friend gave us some Palm Island Salts (black, red and green) as a housewarming gift and we really love them all. Our favorite is the black, which is just amazing, but this red is a close 2nd. It's amazing what a difference it makes in the food we cook, compared to other sea salts we use, and all our guests take notice when I use it! We still use Redmond Sea Salt for day-to-day cooking, and it's very good too, but whenever we want to add something special, we add the black or the red. A single 6-ounce pouch lasted us about 6 months, so a little goes a long way.
1542	4	First, I do have to say our dog Mitzi (a black Chow) enjoys the biscuits and the size is no problem for her, even though she is only 40lbs (small for a Chow). I can't tell if it actually removes tartar, but I am giving it an extra star for that if it does. I am deducting a star because the main ingredient is wheat and a dog should have more protein and fewer carbs in its diet.
1543	5	This is the best waffle mix I have ever purchased. Easy to make. I have a professional waffle maker and this batter makes all the difference. Just like eating out.
1544	5	I love this tea! Not only is it good for your immune system but it helps acheive a clear complexion which is why i bought it in the first place. It also is a powerful antioxidant! I highly recommend it if you're looking for beauty on the inside and out!
1545	5	I wanted a plain wholesome, but fast oatmeal and this is it! I have it every morning and you can mix it with whatever you want. The plus side is there are no added sugars like most instant oatmeals.
1546	5	This is my favorite tea ever, I drink it daily iced. It has a nutty rich flavor almost like a coffee. I used to drink Celestial Seasonings Dessert Teas but as usual another company has discontinued the products. I originally ordered a cse of this from Stash last year and was hooked and hopefully they won't take it off the market. It seems like all that's out there is fruit flavored teas, which I don;t like, so if you like a rich bakery flavor tea, this one is it.
1547	4	It is a good product, high quality ingredients. I find that has a strong broccoli flavor to it, which at least to my adult palette doesn't quite jive with the fruit flavors. However, my daughter seems to just love it so thats all that matters.
1548	5	I personally loved this popcorn. It really is addictive! Came onto Amazon to see if I could get it in bulk b/c my local store started selling it in 2 pack boxes vs. 6 packs and I think that's ridiculous. So happy to be able to buy a big box!
1549	5	My kids love ramen noodles, and although I know they are high in salt and fat I buy them as an occasional treat.  For years their favorite has been the regular chicken flavor, but I bought these creamy chicken flavored ramen noodles after reading the reviews here on Amazon.<br /><br />The kids love them even better than the regular chicken ramen flavor.  They are expensive here on Amazon - .35 cents each as opposed to .20 for the regular chicken flavor at the grocery store.  But with a $25 purchase you get free Super Saver shipping. And I've never seen the creamy chicken brand in stores.
1550	5	Very unhappy manufacturer discontinued this product.  I enjoyed this product for the past several years.  It was a very good and tasty drink which also satisfied a chocolate craving without the sugar and calories.  Please bring it back!!!
1551	5	When I saw that I could recapture a simple childhood pleasure in the form of a favorite candy, (Abba-Zabba) I quickly ordered a box.  It is one of the best decisions I have made for a long time!<br /> Here in the south, you can not find Abba Zaba's and people just look at you funny when you ask if they could get some.  I am slowly working my way through the box, savoring every bite!<br /><br />It is funny how something so simple can bring back treasured memories of a simpler time in life!  If you have never tasted Abba Zaba's, you have missed one of lives little pleasures! Now that I know where to get them, You can bet I will be ordering them again!<br />Hope this helps!<br />Sincerely: Teresa
1552	2	I have bought these for a long time and felt better about the product because I believed them to be of American origin.  I purchased several bags (strips, wrapped apples, etc) and now realize the country of origin is CHINA.  With all the FDA regulations about packaging, it's about time it was mandated that country of origin be prominently displayed (like in 20 font type - not microscopic writing no one notices!!!) ON THE FRONT OF THE PACKAGE!!!  As a result, I will no longer purchase Dogswell products.  As an aside, rawhide is an even worse offender, since the dog can get a much higher dose of any toxins used in curing the hide (and you can bet there are plenty!).  I even picked up a package of a brand named (something like) "U.S.A. Rawhide" and on the back, in fine print, was "Made in China."  Why aren't our legislators doing something productive and cracking down on this?  It's sneaky at best and intentionally deceptive at worst!  Amazon, please find us products for our "furry kids" that won't make them sick or kill them!
1553	5	Dogs love it. It smells like chicken. I have bought the slamon and duck so far and my dogs enjoyed every one of them. I will be buying these treats forever, price is right and is currently the local retailer (online) to purchase it too. Nothing has compared to this without any complications.
1554	5	I purchased this for work because I work at night, and can't drink an entire pot of coffee on my own, (don't like to waste). I hadn't tried instant coffee in ages because I'd never had a positive experience with any brand, until now. Starbucks Italian Roast instant has a strong robust flavor, and will perk you up before you've finished the first cup. I'll definitely be keeping this on hand!
1555	3	I would say this kit is "okay."  Drinkable, but I wouldn't purchase this kit again.<br /><br />Positives: Easy kit to make, labels are decent, corks were acceptable.<br /><br />Negatives:  You HAVE to add wine conditioner to sweeten up this wine.  Of course the kit omits this key ingredient, and says it is something "optional" you can do.  My wife and I both enjoy this type of wine, and have had at least 15 different commercial brands over the years + another we made ourselves a couple years ago (can't recall what kit that was from).  Without the conditioner, it DOES NOT taste like a proper Gewurztraminer.  It's okay tasting that way, but not good.<br /><br />With the wine conditioner, it tasts like a Gewurztraminer, but has a slightly bitter ending.  Also, this is not a 4-week kit.  It took a good 8-weeks total.  Once bottled, even 6-weeks later it's about the same as when it was bottled, so I'm not expecting any more improvement with time.<br /><br />Overall, it's okay, but I'd suggest buying a different kit.
1556	5	High marks for taste & appearance.  Very good price on line compared to local stores.
1557	5	A+++ to Amazon for offering Warehouse pricing<br />A+++ to Amazon for free and very prompt shipping<br />A+++ for delicious convenient cups of dark roast Black Silk Folgers Coffee
1558	5	This pink salt has a very nice subtle flavor. I didn't know salt could vary in flavor until I tried this one. We bought the salt initially because (a) it's organic and (b) my daughter wanted pink salt! But the flavor is what really made the difference. I don't know much about salt, but I want to say that this has a "rounded" flavor meaning it isn't harsh or distinctive on food, rather it seems to become part of the food, going in and bringing back the flavor of the food in an enhanced way. Sounds silly, but I am learning good quality ingredients really make a difference.
1559	5	This has been the only thing to rival chicken treats. Both my dogs smell the salmon when the bag is open & are at there best behavior. Prompt delivery! Excellent service. Saved my figurative bacon!
1560	1	I was considering buying these bars, and I looked at the nutrition information. It said each bar contained 23 calories. This seemed awfully low to me, so I checked the calorie content of other Think Thin bars. They were ten times that much. I think somebody left the zero off, and they're actually 230 calories.
1561	4	This is a great light roast coffee.  Like everyone else has said, you don't get acid gut when drinking this.<br /><br />With that said...the grind is VERY coarse, and does not taste that great when made in a drip coffee maker.  I use this coffee in my french press. You need to let it steep a little longer than other coffees, but the result is the most amazing cup of coffee!
1562	4	This sauce delivers on flavor with a full-bodied, almost fruity taste. It will disappoint hot sauce enthusiasts who will be expecting at least a moderate burn from a sauce with Jolokia peppers. This is not a very hot sauce, falling well short of Tabasco's Habanero offering in terms of heat, and offering none of the punishing burn of the higher-tier Death sauces like Mega or Ultra Death, or Dave's. But you also don't get the bitter pepper-extract taste of those hotter sauces.
1563	5	I got this food for my dog that is allergic to corn, wheat, potatoes, flax, fish, and pork.  I had the hardest time finding a food that he wasn't allergic to.  I'm so glad I found this food.  He is finally eating and starting to put on some weight.  It is a little pricey but I think it is worth it for such a good product.
1564	5	This is the best coffee I have ever had.  No need to add creamer as it is so smooth.[[ASIN:B000C13ORS Lavazza Italian "Qualita Rossa" Ground Espresso (1 case = 20 x 8.8 oz bricks)
1565	5	I have a very picky Chiweenie (chihuahua/mini-dachshund) that loves this food! I tried a few Purina varieties, the Petco brand, several flavors of Blue Buffalo, canned foods - you name it. Finally we have a winner with Wellness! She's maintained perfect weight/health since the switch, has more energy and I've even noticed her coat being extra shiny. I would recommend this to the pickiest of eaters. No more tricks getting her to eat, she literally eats the minute I fill her bowl and wants more. So glad we found this stuff!
1566	5	These are yummy and a great snack for toddlers.  My 22 mo old daughter gobbles these up and she is very picky.  She loves cruncky snacks so it is always a challange to find healthy options she'll actually eat.  These are great, my husband and I love them too.  They are hard to keep stocked in the pantry.  Yes they are still only shipping one 12pack instead of two but they will ship you the addtional one when you call. Hopefully they'll fix that soon.  Otherwise I get these at our Costco too.
1567	5	I have been using this product for lots of years. All of my married children also love the product. It really inhances the flavor of pork and poultry. The product comes from a restaurant in Tacoma, Washington called "Johnny's Dock." It is still one of my favorite places to eat when going back for a visit.
1568	4	My four year old daughter loves these items.  They are also easy enough for her to open and the cap is really large, making it easy.  I assume that the over-sized cap might also be designed that way to prevent choking hazards?<br /><br />Anyway, I like the fact that this is convenient, but the packaging is way too extreme.  I'm sure that this type of single size delivery is not environmentally friendly, but sometimes you need the portability.<br /><br />I tried it and the product had a excellent taste and texture.
1569	3	This is good cereal. I do like it. However, it is not as good as the raisin varieties available by NP. I am not sure what the "berries" are. They appear to be dried strawberries.  The NP Pumpkin Flax is a much better cereal.
1570	5	I have yet to eat one of these great tasting wafers while drinking champagne. While they may be something great to eat with champagne, my wife and I love them just they way they are. We are hooked.
1571	4	The lime taste is pretty prevalent, but it blends in well enough that it's not like the pure lime flavor. The overall taste is like a sweety lime with a kick, I throw hotsauce in with my noodles, and this particular flavor did make me sweat a little. As for the shrimp part of this package, I guess it's in there somewhere. XD
1572	5	i LOVE ALBA  mix it with my LIQUID PROTEIN DRINK so it is like a milk shake and ice cubes and splenda.  dont add any extra water.
1573	5	I'd continue to buy but I'm moving over to more home made finger foods and away from glass jars...shattered too many. They like all the flavors though. Great textures too.
1574	5	If you're familiar with MIO, this is the same stuff. It's a great way to add a dash of flavor to your water. I have no problem with the product, and it arrived exactly as described. I do wish, however, that some better thought would have gone into the shipping.<br /><br />The 3-pack arrived in a standard, padded envelope. While that's well and good, it was obvious that the enveloped had been crushed along the way. A box of some sort would have been a much better option.
1575	5	I've had these before and I can say without doubt or hesitation that they are the best chocolate candies I've ever tasted.  It is important to note that these chocolates are ridiculously prone to melting in warm temperatures, so I recommend them as a winter treat only.  When you get them, put them in the refrigerator immediately after taking a few out to eat them.  They'll keep much better.
1576	4	One of the best things about a fine coffee is the aroma. It is part of the entire coffee drinking experience. It is the aroma that strikes you first with Marley Coffee - One Love. The coffee has a pungent, almost "muddy" odor. By "muddy," I mean it actually smells like mud. This was the hardest thing to get past when trying this coffee. Next up is its light color. It almost brews with the color of a strong tea rather than a coffee. I like my coffee dark, so this was yet another hurdle I had to get past. Once I got to the taste, I was more than pleasantly surprised. The flavor was light, yet wonderfully smooth. There was not a lot of body to it, but it did taste great. This is a light roast at best. If that sounds like what you're looking for, go for it. I give it four stars on taste alone. A nice organic blend.
1577	5	I bought this cheesecloth to make whey and cream cheese from raw milk (recipe found in Sally Fallon's Nourishing Traditions) and never had any problem with it whatsoever.  I don't expect to use any cheesecloth with just one layer so I believe I folded twice when in use, but it won't hurt to fold it a third or even fourth time.  The best part: it comes in a pack of six so you save money.<br /><br />I had no problems with it whatsoever.
1578	5	I am a big cereal eater.  I have tried most all cereals on the market and this one is the best by far!  The pecan clusters give a sweet flavor that satisfies your cravings.  The best way to eat this cereal is with vanilla flavored almond milk!
1579	3	This product has xylitol in it and its useful/good for your teeth, I get it. But, at the end of the day I chew gum to freshen my breath up. The flavor of Spry lasts only for 3-5 minutes. Then you are basically chewing on flavorless gum. You need to chew atleast 2 at a time to feel the flavor. This product might be good for your teeth if used extensively but honestly I think its overrated. You will do as well with any sugarless gum like Trident, which has xylitol too and lasts much longer. Not to mention that its expensive too as compared to Trident or any other sugarless alternatives.
1580	5	Nylabone is the best, longest lasting bones that I have found for my AMSTAFF "Gator" He is a heavy chewer and this is the only bone he cannot destroy.
1581	5	First, you have to like real, bold coffee (which I do) to like this coffee. If you like this coffee, also try Jet Fuel, Organic, and Wake Up Call. Each of these is similar but have slightly different tastes. I like to buy them in boxes of 50 using automatic delivery (can't beat the price that way).<br /><br />The coffee tastes great. I would classify it as bold/extra bold. I gave it 5 stars, and I continue to buy it along with the others that I mentioned.
1582	5	At first you think that these chips aren't all that Spicy, but the spice will grow on you with each bite.  They are really very good!
1583	4	Lipton's Blackberry-Vanilla is a great decaf tea packing major hibiscus/raspberry/rosehip flavor. The aroma is fantastic with just a hint of vanilla, and the tea is fairly tart - a bit surprisingly tart at first sip. The blackberry and vanilla come through in the flavor - but the rosehip/hibiscus/raspberry is definitely the primary taste. I've tried this tea both hot and iced, and enjoyed both. Bonus points for being decaffeinated!
1584	5	This is a robust, aromatic and satisfying blend with balanced acidity and no bitterness.  It's a complex roast that's reminiscent of espresso with a subtly sweet taste, I love it.  I have had a difficult time finding truly strong, yet flavorful coffee for my Keurig brewer--Timothy's coffees are too acidic and Van Houtte blends lacked complexity--and  I've finally found several extra bold flavors from Green Mountain roasts that really deliver that morning one-two punch.  For comparison, my other favorites are the Espresso blend (sadly now discontinued) and Double Black Diamond (a bit more of a smoky flavor).  And for the most potent flavor profile, the Barista Prima Italian Roast is magnifico!
1585	5	I purchased this to use with my Bialetti Moka, and it is delicious!<br /><br />I like to use 2 to 3 heaping teaspoons in my 6-cup maker, and it makes enough for two (large) lattes.<br /><br />It reminds me of working in Starbucks...that smell of delicious brewing coffee and espresso!<br /><br />(Unlike Starbucks coffee, however, this coffee is smooth and doesn't taste burnt at all.)<br /><br />The packaging was a bit smaller than expected, but a little sure goes a long way!
1586	5	This is one of my favorite teas, very smooth, the red tea and vanilla go together quite well<br /><br />I also love the fact there is no soy lecithin  in it, just Rooibus tea, vanilla bean and french vanilla flavor<br /><br />I use to find it on sale in stores frequently but it has been disappearing from shelves so I am happy to find it here on Amazon!<br /><br />simplicity at it's best..highly recommended
1587	1	WHEN THEY CALL IT BREAD THEY ARE TELLING THE TRUTH..........IT'S MOSTLY BREAD WITH A LITTLE FLAVORING INSIDE.  I HAVE BEEN BUYING THIS ITEM FOR A FEW YEARS NOW AND IT'S GOTTEN LOUSIER EVERY YEAR.  AT FIRST IT WAS VERY TASTY WITH LOTS OF CHEESE AND RECOGNIZALE VEGES AND MEATS INSIDE BUT NOT SO ANYMORE.  I DECIDED TO TRY IT ONE MORE TIME AND I REGRET THAT DECISION.  IT'S NOW TASTELESS ROLLS OF BREAD WITH NO CHEESE AT ALL.  AND DRY....OHHH.... SO DRY!!!  I WILL DEFINITELY NEVER BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN.  I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A NEW CHEF BUT I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE IT IS BEING MADE WITH CHEAPER AND POORER QUALITY FOOD WITHOUT SAVING $$ IN MIND.  MAYBE YOU'LL LIKE EXPENSIVE DRY, TASTELESS HUNKS OF DOUGH BUT I DON'T.  I NO LONGER RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. AND DON'T BELIEVE THE PICTURE, IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE THAT ANYMORE!!
1588	3	This product needs to be added directly to apple cider. This product only enhances apple cider it is not a drink itself.
1589	5	With the flu and cold season kicking into gear, I thought I'd give my opinion of the best cough drops on the market:  Halls Mentho-Lyptus.  When taking cold or flu medicine, everybody knows that the closer it gets to your next dose, coughs, throat irritation, and congestion get worse.  Halls helps suppress those symptoms just a little bit longer.  They are especially good at clearing nasal passages and suppressing coughs.  While I'm a fan of the original flavor, there are plenty to choose from.  The standard flavors like cherry and strawberry are there, but new flavors like Canada Dry Ginger Ale are also available.<br /><br />While there are plenty of cough drops on the market to choose from, Halls, in my opinion, has always been a step above the rest of them.  I highly recommend Halls Mentho-Lyptus cough drops.
1590	5	I don't know why, but lately I've had trouble finding these IAMS dog biscuits in the local grocery stores.  Since my German Shepherd loves them, I searched Amazon and found this Pack of 6 deal.  Rudy is happy.  His teeth are staying clean and all is good!
1591	5	NOT OFTEN TO I FIND A CEREAL TO RAVE ABOUT, BUT I GIVE THIS CEREAL RAVE REVIEWS!
1592	5	I highly recommend Kind Plus protein bars. They're tasty, satisfying and get me through a workout or balance me after one. I am slowly switching to a gluten free diet. I say slowly because I am still discovering new products and I'm very happy I found Kind.
1593	5	Great value and wonderful quality.  Your favorite cook will love this gift and you will love what they cook with it.
1594	5	The packaging has poorly welded zipper-strip, so you'll need to clip or rebag any leftovers.  Aside from that, the product is excellent.  Onion moves quickly, so you're getting a fresh product.  Frontier does quality control and stays on top of their products and batch numbers.  Their dried onion flaks are good sized pieces, not just crumbs or powder.  The taste is good, with a faint sweet flavor, not cardboardy.<br /><br />We have used Tones, Frontier, and several others.  It's a commodity product, so there's a limit to the variety you'll find.  Where Frontier really wins out is that it's inexpensive, conveniently packaged, and you can get it on subscribe-and-save.  That's even less expensive, and saves from having to remember where I picked up my last order.<br /><br />This product is two 1-pound bags, and that's a good size for home use.
1595	2	The product was supposedly in stock when I ordered it, but I was told the next day it was on back order.  When the candy arrived, the bars tasted stale.  I will not order from this company again.
1596	5	I love oatmeal raisen cookies so when i heard that Quaker was selling a new soft baked cookie i was ready to try it. I was a little skeptical that it wouldn't live up to my expectations ,but Im glad i was wrong. It's so soft and yummy . it literally could have been a homemade cookie. its a great treat and i will definitely be buying more.
1597	3	What was I THINKING???  Of course these cause stinky gas.  Don't you have that when you eat deviled eggs on the holidays?  I love the Charlee Bear Dog treat line, however, I have to get rid of my 16 ounces of treats because my yellow lab is continually passing gas when I have given him these.  Labs are notorious for stomach issues, so it could be that, but I won't get this flavor again.
1598	3	I made a mistake by not reading the BLEND part on the advertisement, and only found out later when I had it in my hands that it contains sugar. This is not for those who must abstain from sugar! I don't exactly understand why one would need Splenda mixed with Sugar since Splenda alone does just fine and is what I consider a sugar substitute. So make sure you know that this contains real sugar.
1599	5	I love this stuff with just a touch of vanilla creamer. Caramel and vanilla coffee, with the caramel slightly overpowering the vanilla, perfectly balanced with a shot of vanilla creamer. What a great flavor combination, with a heavenly aroma.<br /><br />My favorite flavored coffee.
1600	5	My twin boys both love this food.  It has the best texture of any of the HAPPYBABY meats we've tried.  The pieces of chicken and pasta aren't too big either.  This is great for babies resistant to texture--It has some but not too much!
1601	3	This WAS a great product. It was great tasting and it had a crazy low amount of carbs compared to most anything else out there. For people who need to manage their carb intake, this was a real treat and there wasn't much else out there that compared. There is, I found on receiving my latest shipment, a new formula and the carb count has almost doubled from 8g per serving to 15g. This might not matter to most people but for some it can be a critical issue. I imagine it still tastes great with all the extra sugar and milk or whatever they've added but, unfortunately, this product no longer serves the niche it once did. Where it once was this great-tasting, low-carb indulgence, it's now just one of ten million sugary things out there.
1602	4	We've ordered quite a few of these, they are really tasty!  A bit on the expensive side, but you get what you pay for - cheap jerky is gross.<br /><br />It isn't as good as the home made jerky I used to get from an aunt, but it is certainly close!<br /><br />Also, the company is very responsive and helpful. For one of my orders, instead of getting 3 bags, I only got one.  I emailed the company and they sent out three new bags right away.<br /><br />I think the original is my favorite flavor.  It has a little sweetness to it.  I got the Teriyaki flavor as well, but it was a little too sweet, and some of the other flavors are a little too spicy for me (but I can't handle any spice).
1603	5	My spouse and I both believe the taste is more mellow than traditional table salt -- not as acrid would be perhaps the best way to describe it.  I make my own "sports drink" and it tastes infinitely better with this salt than it does regular salt.  Its texture is lighter and it seems to mix into that drink and other foods easier.  Knowing I'm avoiding another processed food when I use this helps me to enjoy it as well.
1604	5	I got this flavor in the Holiday Pack and it was one of my favorites. I usually don't like a lot of artificial maple flavor, but the flavor in this K-cup is wonderful! It really reminds me of the best French Toast I ever had! As soon as it starts brewing, you start to smell the wonderful aroma and it reminds you of when you were a kid and your mom made French toast just for you! I've never seen these available on their own, so it was exciting to find them here!
1605	4	This was recommended by a friend of mines and since I introduced it to my 3 dogs (different breeds), they act like they cannot get enough. I particularly bought this for my boxer as she has many allergies and so far, she seems to be doing fine on it. I have noticed that her energy is higher than usual and that is the only thing that has changed for her.<br /><br />It is easy to prepare, you can use less and add meat to it if you wish and the dogs just love it....I have 1 fussy eater and so far he has been lapping this up, no hesitation like he had with all other food.
1606	5	I absolutely love this product.  I developed a dairy allergy in my early adulthood and am an avid cook.  I use this cream all the time!  One reason I really like this is that it isn't pre-sweetened, so it works well in cooking where other dairy free creams don't.  I've made pasta sauces, cream soups, french toast and lots of other things. (I'm sure the flavored varieties would be great with french toast!)  I haven't tried the other varieties yet, but I'm excited to try the whipped cream.  If you're trying to cook for someone with a dairy allergy - this product is a must-have in the pantry.
1607	5	De la Estancia Organic Polenta is the best polenta I have ever purchased.  I wanted a fine grind to shorten the cooking time, especially in my solar cooker.  It was also interesting to read in the description that the corn has a long growing season: there has to be a good reason for that--more trace nutrients? better taste? heirloom seed?  The taste is great and well incorporated into favorite recipes.  A great purchase!
1608	3	I purchased this product online because I couldn't find it in the stores at that time (2 days later it was in the store also). It's good that comes quick, save a trip to the store, however, no deal on the price; same as Walmart, Kroger, etc.
1609	5	Absolutely delicious, spicy but not too spicy, peanut-y, great for a simmer sauce, a salad dressing, to drizzle over baking chicken breasts, over fish, etc.  Great to dip things in.  Yummy.
1610	5	Our dog Sophie can only have pure chicken treats due to allergy issues.  These were recommended by our vet and she loves them, simply freeze-dried white meat chicken breast, perfect for her health and her "treat" needs.  And they don't provide "empty" calories like some of the biscuits and soft treats do.
1611	4	My husband takes a Kind bar with him to work everyday. He eats it for his afternoon snack. That way he's not hungry until dinner.
1612	3	The last 3 cases I've ordered had some dented cans located in the center of the case. I've read other coplaints about this also and wanted to warn potential buyers. The problem is not with amazon but with the manufacturer and how the cans are selected to be stocked inside the cardboard flats. I keep ordering for convenience and love Amazon. My cat loves the product and it is hard to find locally or stocked in a store far away. I sift through every case to make sure the seal hasn't been broken on any dented cans and usually throw away a few. My next case arrives in about a week. If it is dent free, I will revise my review and rating.
1613	1	We were having a hard time finding turkey dog treats in our local pet stores so I turned to the web. Although these treats were much more expensive than this we usually buy, I bit the turkey and ordered them as they are our little dogs favorite. Sad to say, these are really like rawhide, not like jerky. They are much harder to chew and she can't even bite through them. Considering the price paid plus shipping, we are not at all satisfied.
1614	4	I've seen studies where Peter Pan Peanut Butter won the taste tests...and wanted to try some.  BUT...I can't find it in ANY Southern California Store that I go to so....Amazon....THANK YOU for making it available.  It IS Yummy~...Not as 'stiff' as some other brands so in warm weather it can drip a bit but still yummy!
1615	5	I really didn't believe it was going to be THAT great - I was mostly interested in saving the tons of paper towels I always use when making bacon.  I just used it for the first time this morning and I am REALLY impressed!  And only one paper towel was used.  The bacon itself has an audible CRRRRUNCH when you bite into it.  My poor arteries - I will now be eating more bacon!  Buy this NOW!
1616	5	I think this is a good toy, but its too hard for my Border Collie to get his food or treats. Food should be smaller to drop it more easily.
1617	5	This was purchased for my daughter and her husband.  I was very pleased with the selection of items in the basket.
1618	1	I placed an order online with Barry Farms on December 29th.  Their website stated that orders would be processed and shipped within 48 hours or at most 7 days. After my initial order confirmation, I heard nothing from the company about when my order would be shipped. I emailed them to ask about my order on January 9th and was responded to on January 12th (14 days after my order was placed) stating that one of my items was back-ordered. Their website specifically states that they do not hold orders for back-ordered items. I then called the company and told them I needed the items (with or without the backordered items) no later than January 22nd.  They ensured me that it would arrive by then.  I received an email on January 18th informing me that my order had shipped without the backordered items and I would be receiving a refund for the missing items.  However, the package did not arrive on the 22nd as promised, forcing me to purchase the items elsewhere.  I then emailed the merchant and asked for a refund of the shipping charges since they do not accept returns.  I was refused, stating that since the error was with UPS, they were not at fault (even though their website says they ship within 7 days, which they did not, and do not hold for back-ordered items, which they did).  This is unacceptable behavior from any merchant.  I should have been able to return my items for a full refund or at minimum received a refund for the shipping charges.  Now I am out $28 for items I no longer need and cannot use.
1619	5	I order this tea every couple of months from Amazon for the great price and it's the best powered Arizona tea.  The taste is great, my kids love it, no caffeine or sugar too.  It's also difficult to find this product in stores.  Highly recommend it!
1620	4	For me, at least, the almond crunch by Mrs. Mays is perfection in a snack, so it is hard to beat.  The pumpkin crunch seemed to have a little bit of a smokey flavor when you first bite in, which was surprising to me (though I have not really had many pumpkin seeds as a snack before), and I was expecting a bit more sweetness to it, similar to the almond crunch.  Overall, this is a great snack, and very addictive once you start munching!  You can tell that Mrs. Mays uses high quality ingredients in their snack foods, making for a great, healthy, tasty snack!
1621	5	These are the best prunes.  If you don't like slimy, wet prunes buy these.  They are drier than others, like a raisin would be.  But, you have to buy them in this type of container.  If you buy them in a foil, zipper package, they are slimy (even the Newman's Own brand), but for some reason, if you buy them in this container, they are not.
1622	5	There is a tasty difference with this product.<br />Though costly, the toasted difference makes a great bowl of oatmeal
1623	5	Not much to say here I've been ordering these for a while now. Simple, good fruit, great taste, no sugar packed syrup and no extra calories.
1624	2	photo does not represent product. Seaweed salad is made mostly of Wakame stems, the bright green crunchy seaweed shown on package. This product give you false information even though there is a very small amount of stems present as stated in the ingredients. Very expensive for each serving.
1625	5	If your dog loves pig ears but you worry about clogging pup's arteries, try these. They satisfy my dog's (1.5 year old lab mix) urge to chew but I don't have to worry about leftover grease spots or deal with slimy plastic wrap. These ears arrive individually wrapped, which is always a plus in my book, and my dog loves them so much that I'm able to get out the door without a guilt trip. I like this product so much that I am moments away from ordering another dozen.
1626	4	another wonderful product by Vita.  Nice and fresh w/tropical flavor.  I still prefer the original flavor though I like this one.
1627	5	these are the BEST! toast light to medium & even the crust is fantastic. Real good with coffee. I'm sad when these are not in my pantry
1628	5	This is my favorite of the Love With Rub spices.  Spritz some shrimp with a little olive oil, sprinkle with this rub, a few minutes on the grill and . . . awesome!  Also makes great seared tuna.
1629	4	It was more tasty than I thought. Every time when I feel boring, it was such a nice snack~!!
1630	5	this is a great option for a dessert without the guilt of calories..excellent taste and fast to make..just add milk and its ready to eat.....i tried butterscotch and chocolate...so far i like chocolate the best.
1631	5	This flavor is strong, as it should be, and not bitter. Doing a blind taste-test, couldn't tell any difference in this espresso and one pulled from my Breville espresso machine.
1632	3	I've got cats.  I gave them tuna.  They ate it.<br /><br />Of course, they ate this tuna, Petite Cuisine Grilled Tuna Treats, with exactly the same gusto that they have with canned dolphin safe tuna, at a fraction - a fraction! - of the price.<br /><br />This product claims "eco-safe fishing practices are used that promote sustainable fishing stocks."  How do we know?  The Marine Stewardship Council seal doesn't have its label on this package.  "Dolphin safe" doesn't give the buyer any insight into seabird safe, sea turtle safe, shark safe (or at least not tied to the shark finning industry), or excessive by-catch.  In other words, I really don't have confidence in any unique "eco-safe" claims.  Heck, the claim that "Our factory does not fish for 4 months of the year in order to maintain fishing stocks in the local waters" doesn't tell me anything.  First, factories don't fish.  Second, fisheries rarely focus on the same species for an entire year; they may switch between swordfish and tuna, or whatever.  As far as I can tell, most Ecuadorian tuna boats use purse seines set over fish aggregation devices.  I don't know how this affects by-catch.<br /><br />As you can tell, I want to be an aware consumer.  This product doesn't give me enough information to determine whether the product comes from a sustainable fishery.  See Seafood Watch for more information.
1633	5	We have made friends recently with an abandoned tabby cat we call Mr. Whiskers. I am sure he would be grateful for most anything on a plate at this stage, still he appears to be a gentleman of discernment. And at first whiff of Petite Cuisine, he settled down to some serious feeding and joyously licked his whiskers afterwards.<br /><br />This is an obviously high end cat food and looks and smells good enough for humans. (Let us hope in this economy it does not come to that.) As long as I can afford it I will continue feeding him this brand. I have seen pets fed cheap food develop terrible tumors on their poor little bodies, so I am committed to serving him the best I can find / afford.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you care about your pet and can afford it I highly reccommend this brand. I was quite impressed by the quality.
1634	3	This is not really so good. IF you are limited in funds then it is an ok chai. I prefer Tazo and have made cuts in other places to afford the Tazo chai. Stash chai is just not a very balanced flavor. It is to heavy on the cloves which dominates the other flavors
1635	5	Helped when I had a cold and soar throat and could not make it to the doctor-- I would purchase again
1636	4	This product is definitely for those who like a strong coffee taste.  This K-Cup can be used with the large coffee setting and still have a strong coffee taste.  I definitely think its worth it.
1637	5	I love this coffee.Ive tried them all and I can describe this coffee in one phrase.<br />IT MAKES ME WANT TO FIX STUFF!!!!Its even better than an energy drink.Its my fav so far.Too strong for morning but I love it in the afternoon.It gives me wings!
1638	5	gave it as a gift as i had seen them in a gormet cooking store--better price here!! was well recieved as a gift-- got lots of ooohs and ahhhs
1639	4	I love Crystal Light. I drink my 2-3 liters of water a day because of Crystal Light. So, when I found out Crystal Light made mocktail-flavored drinks, I had to try it.<br /><br />While the margarita flavor wasn't spot-on (it didn't taste like a freshly-made margarita with real lime but it's a powdered drink so I didn't really expect that), it was still a very tasty alternative to plain water and a nice change-up from my typical raspberry-lemonade flavor. The downsides were that there was a slight fake aftertaste that isn't present in many Crystal Light flavors, and it stirred up into an odd, murky greenish color. However, I did like that it wasn't too sweet, that it had a bit of a fruity flavor, like limeade. I could definitely see this mixed with a shot of tequila for a low calorie margarita. In fact, I think I'll go do that right now. Cheers!
1640	5	This is "The Best  Dried Pineapple ever". All natural and no extra sugar or chemicals.. Ranks way above all others in flavor and health contents.
1641	5	Usually, these products have way too much sugar and are not that healthy.  This one is organic and is low in calories.  I like it as much as my daughter does.  We purchased the variety pack on Subscribe and Save for extra savings too.
1642	5	First bought this product years ago at Whole Foods, loved it! Then suddenly Whole Foods stopped selling it. Tried to find at other supermarkets without any luck, tried to buy similar products individually no luck. Found it on Amazon.com Thrilled!<br /><br />Wonderful for making Chicken Satays, or Chinese Fried Rice. Flavors are authentic, great individually or combined. Love Love Love Boyajian Oils!
1643	5	Newman's Special Blend if by far my favorite k-cup selection. I enjoy the bold taste as I am also an espresso drinker.
1644	5	If you like extra sour cream and onion seasoning on your chips or if you have plain chips and want sour cream this is wonderful. Also it is great for cooking and I even created a snack with it that is awesome. Simply buy oyster crackers and shake them in a bag with a generous amount of seasoning and it is excellent.
1645	5	These are PERFECTION!<br />Small, beautiful, priced right, and arrive VERY quickly.. Perfect for savory tartlets - not too big and not too small - they are wonderful for high end cocktail parties when your guests prefer elegant and taylored over big and sloppy, so if you've run out of time or simply don't feel like making a million tiny tartlet shells, there's nothing better than these..  I TOTALLY recommend them.
1646	3	I purchased this because of the Rose petal and for the taste.  It does have a slight smell and taste of Rose but keep in mind slight; not mild or intense. I won't re-purchase.
1647	5	In the past, I have had a difficult time getting my dogs to take medication. Using this product, they always remind ME that it is treat time.
1648	5	I have a very finicky Shih Tzu that normally turns his head to most treats, but not this one!  When he sees me open the bag he does circles waiting for this!  Have already ordered more bags!  Don't want to be without!  Highly recommend!
1649	1	If I could give this product 0 stars, I would. The description sounds great but what they forgot to mention is that when the urine clumps up it doesn't go through the spaces. This cat litter box causes triple the mess to clean up. Buyer beware. Don't waste your money!
1650	5	We LOVE this product--have used it for years!  But lately, we can't find it in the local stores. We are so relieved that we could order it online!<br /><br />It's sweet, but with a nice sassy kick! Great on buttered English Muffins, toast, or crackers.<br /><br />Our mistake is that we only ordered four--and in less than a month, we're on our third one already!
1651	5	I bought this flavor for the first time at the store, when they were out of my favorite (Sweet N Hot). My kids (ages 4 and 2) were begging me for some when we got back to the car. I told them they could try it, but that it would be spicy. They agreed, took the small bites I gave them and continued to ask for more until the entire package was gone! The flavor is exactly as the title describes. It's sweet and spicy, and reminds me of a dish I would order at a Thai restaurant. It's not as Spicy as the Sweet N Hot, but it still has quite a kick. It's not my favorite flavor, but I still give it 5 stars for the great texture and good flavor (and the fact that my kids devoured it). I bought this package with my kids in mind. I am all for natural products that they enjoy!
1652	3	I followed all the instructions and great guidance from this site, but my dog - a rescue dog, formerly an outside dog and not used to 'toys' didn't figure this out. Perhaps if another dog showed him the way, he'd get it. The product otherwise was well-made and a creative idea!
1653	4	i put it in a glass jar for chow watmore ken i talk about it is pink salt i resifet it fest
1654	1	I give my dogs very wholesome food. So when I give the occasional treat, I want it to be enjoyed by my dogs. Meaning, I want the experience to be motivating and rewarding. After testing this product on all three of my dogs, I think this stuff is too organic and wholesome for me and my pooches.<br /><br />CONS - When I opened the bag, I noticed these organic treats were very hard. I couldn't break them up with my hand to give in little pieces or use for training. I had to give the treat as a whole biscuit. Also they were very fibrous looking. Much like those unappealing high-fiber diet bars that humans eat when they're on some sort of regimented weight loss program. Also, I prefer my dog treats to be in cute shapes...bones, hearts, rounds, rolls, etc. These were just regular squares. And since the cookies were so hard, I was afraid the corners would cut the mouths/gums of my smaller dogs.<br /><br />PROS - If you read the label, the ingredients are high quality. They're the stuff I look for when I buy their every day food.<br /><br />Dog tested: My big German Shepard, who usually likes chicken jerky treats (and won't eat anything that has a smoky flavor like Beggin Strips), ate her biscuits. However, she wasn't terribly interested and definitely didn't think it was treat. It looked as if she just ate it because it smelled edible and it was there. She didn't even wolf it down like she normally does with her treats. My Cocker Spaniel, who usually begs me for everything and is highly food motivated, took a sniff and and a lick but ultimately was not interested in these wholesome treats. As for my little Pomeranian, well it was too hard and big of a biscuit for him.<br /><br />Even thought these treats are supposed to be nutritious and healthy, I only gave them 1 star because my dogs and I didn't enjoy them.
1655	5	I have an older Newfie and he has had skin problems most of his life.  Unfortunately, he is also a very picky eater, so finding a balance between what he will eat and what is good for him has been tricky.  He really likes this food!  Finally, my worried mom's heart can rest.  His skin issues are clearing and he doesn't scratch like he wants to peel off his skin.  I highly recommend if your dog shares these issues... get this food, mix it with some sensitive skin wet food or even salmon... your dog with thank you!
1656	5	This was my first purchase of Twinings Earl Grey Tea K-Cups for my Keurig. I was hoping it would be at least as good as making a pot of tea. I was not disappointed. In fact, I find them to have a fuller body and stronger flavor than a cup from a tea pot. It is handy and quick as popping one in and pushing the brew button.<br /><br />My biggest concern when making this purchase was that it would pick up the flavor from a previously brewed cup of coffee. It did not. As a precaution I do rinse the inside of the cup holder before I brew a cup of tea, however, even times when I don't I can't tell the difference. So now I can have a great cup of Twinings Earl Grey with better results than a brewed pot of tea, much faster and with less waste. I fully recommend this product.<br /><br />I might also add, I have tried many brands of Earl Grey Tea and Twinings is the only brand that I enjoy. I'm elated that I can now get it in K-Kups! Thanks Twinings!!
1657	5	a great gluten free product wityh a real taste of lemon. This is not a washed out flavor but a excellent mix of sweet and tart in a light crunchy wafer cookie.
1658	5	I was a bit skeptical about this product before trying it, as I am not a soda drinker by any stretch of the imagination. However, I decided to give it a go. Not only was I not disappointed, I absolutely LOVED it!<br /><br />The Izze Fortified All-Natural Juice (I tried the Grapefruit version) is light and refreshing and JUST sweet enough (not cloying the way sodas can be). Its crisp taste and gentle bubbles remind me a great deal of Orangina, which I always liked. The cans are smaller than regular soda, which I also view as a good thing, as I can never finish a whole can on those occasions when I do drink it. The fact that this drink is also fortified with vitamins is an added bonus (though I've gotta say that the fortification is a bit weak; nothing terribly exciting there).<br /><br />I look forward to trying the other flavors, but I am totally sold on IZZE and can, with a clear conscience, recommend it most highly!
1659	3	I really looked forward to getting this coffee.  However, the coffee pods smelled much better than they tasted.  I could not tell any flavor apart from the other.  Decent tasting but a regular Senseo back for 1/3rd the price tastes just as good.
1660	4	Kettle Chips Spicy Thai potato chips have the perfect amount of sweet, savory and spicy-- everything you'd want in a good meal or better yet...a potato chip.  Since these are kettle-cooked, the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit over-browned.  They are, however, sliced just perfectly, not too thick, not too thin, so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off.  The flavor is tremendous, although I wouldn't describe it as Thai.  It's more of a vague, sweet and tangy flavor with a kick, and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger.  If you like any spice at all, these really are not overly spicy, so most people can handle them.  The fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any muncher's snack cupboard.
1661	1	I just had a bowl of this stuff.  It tasted all tomato with no meat of any kind.  In fact, the soup itself is pretty much like brown gravy with tomato paste or tomato sauce added.  There is no meat at all.  You could eat a bowl of it with a sturdy straw.  It was gross.  I will not even have it again.
1662	5	The best veggie jerky on the market. period. As a former Tofurky Jurky junkie, and not being able to find the tofurky brand jerky anywhere (including Vegas!) at whole foods, online, etc. . I was on the hunt for some high protein TASTY jerky. I tried cactus jerky, primal brand jerky, and a few others and they just didn't measure up and didn't taste anything like beef jerky.<br /><br />I was super excited when my order arrived (I got the variety pack) and I tried them one at a time (one per day) and loved every single one of them.<br /><br />While the flavors aren't vastly different, there are subtle differences, giving folks who like spicy, sweet, smokey all a "favorite".<br />Cowgirl tastes the most like the Tofurky brand jerky. I honestly love all of their flavors and will be ordering more and some extra to take with me to Burning Man this summer.<br /><br />Amazing stuff! So happy to have found them. :)
1663	5	I have used chi-chi's seasoning for a long time. It became very hard to find in the stores and if I did find it ,I would buy all they had.  This is the best seasoning I have used and you cannot find it in the stores anymore. My sister found it on amazon and I ordered two cases which I shared with family members. This is a great product,and at a great price.
1664	5	Celestial Seasons has one of my favorite K-Cup teas in English Breakfast tea.  I am a repeat customer in buying this brand of tea.
1665	5	Every morning this is my second cup. It's smooth, has a really nice "coffee" taste and leaves me feeling satisfied for that coffee urge. I can drink this cold it's that good! Too bad the prices keep going up!
1666	5	This has been my favorite pizza sauce for decades.  Only one I'll use, nice and thick, easy to spread on the crust and stays thick throughout the cooking, so that it's not just a wet, runny mess.  Fantastic flavor.  I've lived all over the world and this is the one I always return to.  I prefer it to all the homemade ones people have had me try as well, it's that good.<br /><br />Their shipping, however, is atrocious.  Of the 12 cans that arrived, only one was unscathed.  And only two will be able to be opened by my can opener.  They have them encased in a small short box with plastic wrap, but the larger box they send it out in is not sufficiently packed.  So the cans are all bent, one had actually opened.  I'll have to buy a manual can opener in hopes of being able to open the 9 cans that are useless now for any electric opener.<br /><br />Prices here were far better than the only store in my area that carries these, but it's not worth the hassle for the mangled cans I ended up getting.
1667	5	Im not a fan of hot coffee (even in the dead of winter), so this works perfectly for me!  It does blend it better with hot water so i usually use a little bit to mix it in and then fill it up with cold water.  I picked up the 50 pack for cheap before Christmas, but its kinda pricey otherwise.
1668	5	the whole office seems to favor this coffee, enough flavor to make it stand out from regular but not overpowering
1669	5	Plocky's chips are made of several whole grains and have a touch of sweetness.  They are a little lower in fat and sodium than regular tortilla chips.  The flavor out performs any tortilla chip I have ever eaten.  They hold up great to salsas and dips.  Nothing wimpy about them.  I just wish the company made a bigger bag!  Love them.  Usually found in the organic foods section of the grocery, but seem to be difficult to obtain as the shelf is always empty.  Order by the case.  You'll be glad you did as they disappear fast.
1670	5	At McDonalds I always have the Rolo Mcflurrey for dessert and I go nuts when I eat it. Then I found out who sells Rolo chocolates and bought them right away. I was jumping as high as the ceiling when I was opening them. When I tasted them. I fainted. Anyway this is a great party favor and a great snack for all ages!
1671	1	This was the first of the two litter pearl products I tried.  It sounded great.  It cost a little more, but the whole concept seemed wonderful.  I scooped it out every day and thought it was great until I hit day 22.  Then the crystals soaked up the urine, turned yellow, stayed wet, and then became very malodorous.  I had to change the whole thing out at 4 weeks, which kind of changes the long lasting, no odor idea and GREATLY increases the cost.  Maybe my kitten (who loves his litter box) is different and I am never going to find kitty litter that works.  I can't believe he continued to use this when I couldn't even stand to be within 10 yards of the box because of the smell.<br /><br />I was very disappointed.
1672	5	I am not a very big fan of green tea. I have always found the flavor to be a bit strong. I have had real Moroccan mint tea and found that to be a bit strong as well (in the mint direction). This tea was the perfect mild blend of both for me. And because it is all natural (no artificial or "natural" flavorings) I have been able to drink it every other day on my detox.<br /><br />Please Note: I did not purchase through Amazon. I purchased a box at Target. I would recommend trying it before investing in 6 boxes. I do plan to order this offer thru Amazon once my current box is depleted.
1673	1	I never received this product as inside the box marked "Variety Pack" was 18 packages of Chocolate flavored coffee pods.  After this happening 2 times, the order was cancelled.
1674	5	First and foremost make sure you DO NOT let this tea steep too long. If you let it steep for the recommended two minutes, you shouldn't have to run to the bathroom like your pants are on fire! If you let it steep for the 2 minutes, it's a decent trip to the bathroom...not explosive diarrhea.<br /><br />With the way we eat (mostly women) we need to clean out our plumbing every once in a while and this is a fabulous way to do it. It's not recommended for everyday use!
1675	5	I use this coconut oil as a skin softener.  It is fabulously rich and it smells good too.  I also use it on my hair when doing a heat treatment.  It strengthens the hair shaft and makes hair healthy and resists split ends.
1676	1	These crackers used to taste delicious and, although not necessarily the healthiest snack, they were really great to munch on! But, I just recently opened a box and, after one telltale bite, I was disappointed to find that they now add autolyzed yeast extract, a common favor enhancer that is practically the same as MSG.  I have adverse reactions to both MSG and autolyzed yeast extract. Too bad they ruined this product for me and other MSG-sensitive folks out there.  I wonder why they did it?!
1677	1	$18 plus $11.70 = 29.70 for 8 pies ????!!!<br /><br />You'd have to be high on drugs to order this, seriously ...
1678	3	I wish they would have noted the expiration date, it is not even 60 days from the date of delivery.
1679	5	This tea is great!  A little sweet. Tastes great.  Kids like it also, great hot alternative to a cup of sugary hot chocolate.  Really makes a sore throat feel a lot better!  Seems to help shorten and/or prevent colds.  One of our favorites!
1680	5	I got these for the hubby and son. Their birthdays are on the same day and I was planning on splitting them up between them since they both love licorice.<br />I had to test them of course. Very nice. A touch grainy in my opinion but still delish!!<br />They are also individually wrapped which is great since they are going in a candy dish for the hubby's desk at work.<br />Very pleased with this product all around.
1681	5	I am very leery of "energy drinks." I have never tried Red Bull or Rockstar, and I really don't plan on it either. The thought of pumping myself with artificial energy (sugar and caffeine) and then crashing hard is just not very appealing to me. So, I was likewise hesitant with 5-hour Energy.<br /><br />After hearing all of the radio ads, though, and constantly seeing these little red bottles on the gas station counters, I had to give it a shot. I kind of coughed it down the first time as the flavor wasn't real great to me, but I figured it was only 2 ounces and I could get it down. I'm sure glad I did, because I was amazed at what it did for me. Using vitamins and minerals (and the same caffeine dose as in a cup of coffee), I was given energy that lasted and did not cause me to crash!<br /><br />I try to keep some of this stuff on hand (berry is my favorite by the way) and I usually take this when I am feeling like I really need a nap but the nap isn't an option. While it doesn't instantaneously feel like leaping off roofs, if I can motivate myself to start some project, within a half an hour I notice I am not tired anymore! This energetic (and non-sleepy) feeling last for quite a while too, so I don't take this beyond perhaps 4 or 5pm if I want to get to sleep that night.<br /><br />I cannot tell you how many people I have gotten started on this. Usually it starts with something like this: Them--"Does that stuff really work?" Me--"Yes! It's awesome, and it isn't like most energy drinks. This is really vitamins. Here, try this!" Them (two weeks later)--"Wow! That stuff really does work. I have been buying it now!"<br /><br />This is highly recommended for safe and healthy pick-me-ups! (Can I give it 10 stars?)
1682	5	Very early this year (2010) my vet diagnosed my cat with a urinary tract infection and gave her Royal Canin Urinary SO canned food.  She liked it somewhat and seemed to get better.<br /><br />When the vet said that she would have to come back for another office visit I decided to try the Purina urinary tract equivalent.<br /><br />My cat just loves it!  When hungry, she finishes off a 3 ounce can in about 15 minutes.  I still give her the vet food as well but she never finishes off that food as a fast.  She also eats the Purina dry food, that I leave out, but not nearly as fast.<br /><br />Unfortunately she is sick again(weight loss - but not Hypothyroid).  Blood work has not determined what is wrong with her.  He wants another $500 for xRays and other stuff.  She nearly 17 years old, so I'm not sure what I'll do.
1683	4	It is hard to tell most of the time if supplements work but I just have a greater sense of well being when I take this product. It really is a good source for essential fatty acids. I expect to keep taking it.
1684	5	This coffee is grrreat! Smooth and not a bad after taste. I am drinking it right now and was searching online to see where I could get another batch. My cousin just brought me some from italy and she is also inlove with it! Yes - the packaging is annoying but I have a coffee tin that I pour the grinds into so that is not a big issue for me.
1685	5	Second time ordering these from Amazon.com~  very fast shipping and the product was as good or better than description!  Gave some away as gifts in little bags with bows-  got responses that my friends wanted to know where they could buy them as well!  Delicious tart cherries!!!  Great to eat plain or add to oatmeal or recipes!
1686	4	You never know when a small amount of hi quality paste will be needed and this fit's the bill perfectly every time.  Very handy and accesible, just throw the partially used tube in the fridge for next use.
1687	5	These Sumatra beans, upon opening the package, glistened with their natural oils.  The flavor is deep and rich.  Great price at about $6/lb. and fast shipping.
1688	4	I ordered the wine gummies because I remembered loving them as a child, and their intense flavor seemed sealed in my tastebud memory... The shipment included three huge bags of the candy (too few of the black/purple and red ones, IMO--seriously disproportioned toward the white and yellow), and the candy is good. The flavor is almost as I remember--somehow I thikn that childhood gave the candy an extra 'oomph' which this experience now, in adulthood did not share... But, these are still very good gummies, excellent consistency--not too sticky, not too soft. I've shared some (it is a LOT of candy) with others, who loved them as well. I recommend this purchase if you love gummies and want a change from the boring bears...
1689	5	This mints have a wonderful flavor and leave the mouth dry and fresh - not "sticky" as some mints do.  Highly recommended!
1690	2	I just love my Keurig and I've enjoyed tasting all of the different coffees in the sampler pack so when I ordered this hot cocoa I thought it would be as good as the coffee. I was wrong, dead wrong. This cocoa is terrible and tastes like sugary hot water. You honestly get no chocolate taste at all. I had such high hopes for this hot chocolate and all I have now is the hot cocoa blahs.
1691	5	I love salted and smoked almonds. I had never even heard of Butter Toffee almonds before.  But, wow, I'm glad I tried them.  They are just sweet enough to satisfy my sweet tooth without overwhelming you with a sugar taste.<br />Another reviewer was right, they taste a lot like french toast.  I'm definately buying these again.
1692	5	And more importantly, it loves my cat.  I am the owner of a new cat that I started out on a supermarket indoor cat formula, since he had been fed dry food while at the shelter.  While the cat ate this other food heartily, he soon began vomiting on a daily basis.  I did some research on the internet and found that this food, Natural Balance, is considered to be among the best cat foods out there of the dry variety.  Since my cat would not really touch wet food at the time, I decided to give it a try.  Not only did my cat love it, but all of his problems with vomiting disappeared overnight.  I am currently feeding him a combination of Natural Balance Original dry and a variety of wet foods.  He is doing great so far...lots of energy...and he really looks forward to mealtime.  My cat and I recommend this food!  :)
1693	5	I bought the tea for my mother who has asthma.  She said it tastes great and does wonders for her asthmas.
1694	5	Thick and Chunky! Well, I like my oatmeal that way anyway. It takes a bit longer than regular oatmeal to mush up, but who cares!
1695	5	No more liquid medicine all over ME! No more begging, no more chasing little kitty to give him his medicine. He waits by the pantry for his morning meds! Pills in pill pockets-the ONLY way to go!!!
1696	5	These are the sweetest snack ever and full of antioxidants.  I keep them at work to pop or toss them into my hot or cold cereal.  They are always fresh and on time.
1697	5	It is so hard to find pet food that does not contain corn products as the main ingredient, or even the first two main ingredients.  I checked every single package at my local market and this product was the ONLY one that appeared to have healthier ingredients, even compared to other products that were labeled as healthy alternatives.  I know lately more have come on the market, but I already know both of my cats love this food.  And with Subscribe & Save, the deal on Amazon is better than the one at my market.<br /><br />Finally, here is the full main ingredient list:<br /><br />Ingredients<br /><br />Salmon, chicken meal, whole brown rice, soybean meal, whole barley, whole oat meal, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), soy protein isolate, brewers dried yeast, dried egg product, dried beet pulp, natural flavor, fish oil, phosphoric acid, calcium carbonate, whole cranberries, caramel color, dried tomatoes, dried spinach, salt, potassium chloride, taurine, choline chloride, calcium phosphate, Vitamin E supplement, zinc sulfate, ferrous sulfate, niacin, manganese sulfate, Vitamin A supplement, calcium pantothenate, thiamine mononitrate, copper sulfate, riboflavin supplement, Vitamin B-12 supplement, pyridoxine hydrochloride, folic acid, Vitamin D-3 supplement, calcium iodate, biotin, menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of Vitamin K activity), sodium selenite.
1698	5	We bought two from Williams Sonoma.  I loved them so much that when I saw them listed on Amazon, I bought another one.  They are perfect for making baby food and for freezing small portions of often used items like tomato paste.  I also froze 1 Tbsp portions to use when I cook.  Love this product!
1699	5	My senior kitty is able to digest this quality cat food.  Other brands were an issue in terms of an upset stomach and vomiting.  It is well worth the incremental cost for the peace of mind it brings.  Highly recommend!
1700	2	I sometimes get notes from my cat Steve regarding his food, litter, toys etc. and I post them here. - - I know, its weird<br /><br />Dear Grocery Lady,<br /><br />Please don't think because I am of the feline persuasion that I did not see and understand the "buy 1 get 1 free" coupon I saw for this terrible food. In case you didn't get the hint that I don't like this and you should never bring it again, I threw up in your shoe as gentle reminder.<br /><br />You know I have a delicate digestive system and a discerning palate.  Stick to the cuisine I like....don't go rogue again!<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Steve-the-cat  ,,,^. . ^,,,~
1701	5	LOL Some fool is running around here and dissing every single page this<br />product appears on claiming this sauce tastes like a "re-branded cocktail<br />sauce" and will make your food taste like shrimp. WHAT? I swear the internet<br />has made idiots out of half the population.<br /><br />First of all, this Chili Sauce is mandatory for making a good homemade<br />cocktail sauce, just add horseradish and lemon juice. It is also mandatory<br />in any variety of cocktail meatballs recipes. in salad dressings, for making<br />spaghetti sauce and yes, even in a pot of chili, just don't pour this into<br />a skillet of ground beef and expect that you now have Chili!<br /><br />This stuff also makes a great Sloppy Joe, and is even good as a dip for<br />fries and burgers. Very versatile, and no kitchen should be without a<br />bottle of this.
1702	5	The Quaker Oatmeal Squares are great tasting in milk or right out of the box. Made with whole oat and wheat flours they are exceptionally crunchy wet or dry. Unlike other cereal squares, the Quaker Squares are more dense (higher fiber) and are ribbed and have a solid oat taste that seems only lightly sweetened. I like them in milk but routinely eat the squares dry for dessert.<br /><br />For a serving size of one cup, there are 210 calories, 2.5g of fat (.5g saturated), 190 mg of sodium, 9g of sugars (brown sugar and sugar), 5g of fiber, and 6g of protein.  Although this list may not be the best for some people, the Oatmeal Squares may be a good substitute for  the high fat and sugar cereals that children (and adults) like. I think the solid crunch of the squares that holds up in milk will appeal to children, and they will not miss the super sweet taste of their current favorites.<br /><br />The price of food world wide is increasing, so you can expect a substantial price point per 21g box. But, unlike other cereals in comparable box sizes, you can feel the higher weight of the Quaker Oatmeal Squares. The density of the cereal in milk gives you a long-lasting full feeling, and when eaten dry makes for a great dessert substitute for cookies.
1703	5	This pasta is really delicious, as well as being considerably lower in calories than regular pasta, and having 18g fiber per serving. I agree that it is a bit blander tasting that regular pasta, but I actually like that: since it doesn't overwhelm the sauce you are using (the way whole wheat pastas tend to do), it allows the sauce to be the star of your dish. A 2-ounce portion is very satisfying. The sampler is a nice way to try it out. Mine came with 2 boxes each of penne, rotini, and linguine. Will definitely recommend it friends!
1704	5	This is the best cocoa that I have ever used!  The chocolate flavor is much richer than Hershey's or Nestle's.  You can even see the difference in the color of the cocoa...much deeper brown color.  My brownies with chocolate icing are better than ever after trying this brand!
1705	3	I am gluten and dairy allergic so I am always looking for variety.  These are okay but they seem fattier than corn chips...maybe it is the lower fiber content.  I read here that "corn goes straight to your hips".  I have never heard that but it seems that a higher fiber content would be valuable.  The pico de gallo are much better than these plain ones.  I am not going to throw them in the trash but they are not very yummy.
1706	5	Not too weak, not too strong, it's juuuuuust right<br />I found these first at my local supermarket. I've been looking for a blend that I could use as my standard every-day cup of coffee and, finally, this was it. I've tried so many of the other blends and brands and they were either harsh and bitter (I know, some people think coffee *should* taste that way!) or too bland and weak. This is smooth but with a nice "coffee"...<br /><br />~~~~~~Now if I could only get the decal breaskfast blend for the same price!~~~~~
1707	5	Love these tortilla chips made with organic white corn!  They are perfect for dipping in salsa or eating right out of the bag.  3g of fiber per serving and there are 8 servings per bag.  Mine were fresh with an expiration date of June 2011.  I will be buying these again.
1708	5	Peak blew away my expectations... I had tried powdered milk before. Never have I had milk taste this good. I use it as a staple in my diet and never worry about spoilage. Great for your survival stash. Highly recommend.
1709	4	WE USE SEASONING FROM HELL WHEN WE MAKE HOT CHICKEN WINGS.. GIVES THEM A LITTLE KICK (BAM).. WE ALSO USE THIS SPICE IN JUST ABOUT ALL DISHES WE MAKE (NO SALT AND PEPPER NEDED)..
1710	5	The 21 ounce Pro-Treat Beef Liver Treats are a great value and my dog loves them.  I just need to reach for the tub and she will sit and put up her paw.  I even cut them into tiny pieces sometimes and sprinkle them onto her food.  She gobbles up her food when I do that.  This size will last a while.
1711	5	I love all of the HappyBaby pouches because of their fresh taste and healthy ingredients. My toddlers love feeding themselves with these. I also mix it in their yogurt and even make smoothies for myself. This is one of my favorite flavors to use because of the health benefits of blueberries and beets (plus my little ones love the taste!) HappyBaby makes it so easy to introduce my kids to a wide variety of fruits and veggies.
1712	1	These prices are a rip-off I order directly  from Tassimo get free shipping and the coffee is half the price
1713	2	For some reason my husband ordered a TON of this stuff for me for Christmas.  We live in Chicago & it's cold so I didn't try it right away.  I was craving something sweet so I finally made some tonight.  It tastes like icy chocolate, & it's a bit chalky.  To be honest it reminds me of the old powdered slimfast.  I've got a whole canister and 5 packets of this stuff & I don't know what I'm going to do with it.
1714	5	One of my favorite restaurants serves this tea iced. They were kind enough to share the brand name with me when I asked. It makes wonderful, refreshing and healthful iced tea. Highly recommend.
1715	4	They keep me awake when I need to be without any side effects - this is my coffee/soda
1716	5	I just tried Aloha Islands 100% estate grown Kona coffee (diamond) and I I can say is WOW!<br />Great taste and the finish is sooooo smooooth!
1717	5	I bought this honey based on the good reviews here on amazon. Arrived quite promptly. I like this crystalized white honey.
1718	2	I would not recommend this product. There was no flavor and it does not taste good.<br />The chick peas were not crisp.
1719	5	I needed raw pumpkin seeds to use in gluten-free cookies, but my kids have peanut/nut allergies so I had to find peanut/nut-free too. These worked great! I ground them in a coffee grinder to make flour and the cookies were fantastic. Will definitely be ordering from Gerb's again.
1720	5	I was looking for an alternative to all of the unhealthy mints on the market with so many dangerous chemicals in them(ie,aspartame & acesulfame K...). I found these at my local organic food store & was hooked! I love the Wintermint & Chai flavors the best.This is a quality company to deal with! When I had a slight problem with a few mislabled tins, I emailed them & received an immediate response from the President of the company! 2 days later I received replacement packages -free of charge! Great tasting mints and Great Customer Service!
1721	1	This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.
1722	1	This bone is nothing more than a very expensive dog biscuit. My dog consumed the entire thing in less than 20 minutes. He really enjoyed it, but there is no way I'm going to buy another one. There are a lot of  more durable bones that cost the same or less than this one. I do not recommend it at all.<br /><br />My dog loves Nybone products. All the other ones seem to last a long time. I guess this "Edible" line is just made for eating and not chewing. In my opinion, the price is way too high for what you get. I highly recommend other Nybone products, but steer clear of this one.
1723	3	I've been trying a lot of different varieties of k-cups lately, and these Kahlua ones are "tolerable". Not bad but nothing I would buy on a regular basis. The also seemed similar to Van Houtte Creme Brulee, which I didn't care for much either.
1724	5	I tried this special coffee last month, fell in love with the low acid notes in my morning pick-me-up, and have never looked back on other brands. Hands down, this is the best of the best in our household.<br /><br />The eco-friendly packaging, compared to other K-cups, puts other manufacturers to shame. In this case, less is more. And better. And environmentally-friendly. I like that the coffee is organic, and that rain forests around the world benefit from the production of their coffee beans (fair trade, shade grown), packaged and produced. Even with my coffee, I am looking for ways to help support eco-friendly businesses and products.<br /><br />And with this order, you receive eighty k-cup pods for thirty-three dollars. It is affordable and tastes great. Recommended.<br /><br />T.B. Grant<br />9.9.12
1725	5	You can tell by the color that this teriyaki sauce is a little different from what you're used to in the teriyaki sauces that have gluten. However, in this case Different Is Better! I have used this sauce in recipes that call for teriyaki, always great in every recipe. The surprise is, this sauce can be used as a stand-alone -- by itself, without any other ingredients, it makes a great marinade. Granted, it's a little thicker than traditional teriyaki sauces, so if you need it thinner you might want to add a little water. But this stuff really ROCKS. My very picky hubby who does not have to avoid gluten and typically turns his nose up at gluten-free stuff actually prefers this teriyaki sauce over all others.
1726	5	The product was excellent and one I have used in the past.  I have used this on-line grocery site through aol for two other orders since and have been well pleased with everything I have received from this on-line market.<br /><br />Though the shipping charges through UPS are high, that is something out of this site's control.  Thank you for sponsoring the shopping opportunity through your servers
1727	5	I couldn't find kettle corn popcorn in any stores other than three small bags in a box. I am very pleased to be able to buy a large batch and for such a good price. I have bought three different orders of this and will continue to do so.
1728	5	My partner thinks this is the best horseradish ever.  I really like it too.
1729	5	ACV helps with allergies.<br />For the first time in my life I can cut grass and do tree/shrub trimming without needing a pocket-full of tissues and being stuffy and miserable for hours after.  I also noticed I have a bit more energy.
1730	5	I first obtained this product in a gourmet chocolate shop in Punta Gorda, Florida.  I enjoyed it very much, but after returning home to Maryland I had no idea where I could purchase more.  I went to Amazon and there it was.  Thank you, Amazon.
1731	5	My hot-loving tastebuds are thrilled and nice to know it is not irradiated. Love to sprinkle on 90% cocoa bars for some sweet heat!
1732	5	Thanks to hubby's recent diagnosis of gluten allergy, I've begun to explore the world of gluten free foods. While some are quite bland, these little cookies pack a flavorful punch! Nothing "depriving" here.
1733	5	We love these crisps.  They are akin to a cracker as opposed to a potato chip.  As such, we use them in soup now all of the time and they are so much better than soup crackers.  We also use them with cheese and as the legend on the package tells you, the sellers developed them for their then cheese store.  However, these crisps became so popular that they left the cheese business for this instead. These are actual New York bagels, sliced and put back into their ovens to become crisps.  I buy a big bag of these at Sam's Club locally. I've also tried Stacy's chips but like these better.
1734	5	If you love butter beans you are gonna want to marry these little guys. Give em a go in whatever recipe calls for them but watch out or the flavor they just might send your buds over the edge!
1735	4	These are WONDERFUL -- BUT, the title makes it sound like you get 24 bags that are 8.46 ounces each. NOT SO! Each bag is only 0.35 ounces. The 8.46 ounces is the amount you get for all the bags put together.<br /><br />As I said, these are wonderful! But they are very expensive for the amount you get.<br /><br />I gave them 4 stars because the title is deceiving! If you zoom in on the picture, you'll see the bag says 0.35 ounces.
1736	4	I really like this k-cup flavor.  Natural is right!  Sure seems fresh and exactly as described...not too sweet, an intense apple flavor with a touch of cinnamon.
1737	4	I didn't plan on writing a review for this product. I mean, it's dog food. I don't eat it! But I read a review or two that complained about dogs getting gas after eating this. I have three dogs: 11.0 pounds, 33 pounds and 96 pounds. I tried to mix like is always suggested, but my dogs just made a mess and picked out the new stuff like they always do. I held out and hoped they'd finish of the old brand, but they didn't, which is par for course with my dogs. (I'm weak.) So I just threw out what little was left of the old stuff and didn't bother mixing anymore. My two smaller dogs had no issues. My larger dog got some horrible gas, like she always does when we go through with food changes, and she seemed a bit bloated and crampy. That lasted about a day or two and she's been fine ever since. Well, old Sadie still has gas from time to time, but that's not uncommon for her size. At any rate, she's always gotten a case of the gas from time to time, just like her daddy (me). My bottom line: My dogs like it, my wife is satisfied with the ingredients, and the price isn't insane. I intend to buy it for awhile and see...
1738	1	Worst quality, All I got is powder in packets, Even thought I was not able to find how to returns. I had to throw all packs. Very disappointed will never suggest this product to anyone.
1739	5	There are just so many things that a college kid can make in a dorm room. Since there is a microwave, this has become a big hit. I was happy to find that I could just send this directly from Amazon with my free Prime shipping. My granddaughter is always grateful when she gets a package at school. She called me directly to ask for more Mac and Cheese. Seems the kids are really enjoying these cups late at night when they are studying!
1740	5	This is the only wheat grass so far that I have been able to drink and actually enjoy!! The benefits are amazing and it really does give you an energy boost.
1741	4	We've tried many organic jerkys, but this has less sugar than other brands. Not only that, but it is great tasting and is pretty soft, so you don't jerk a tooth out!
1742	3	I'm used to seeing those MIO bottles around, so this bottle was MUCH bigger than I was expecting. It's closer to a medium sized bottle of mustard, just to give you an idea.<br /><br />I didn't like that I really had to experiment as to how much "a squeeze" consisted of. "A squeeze" could mean a split second or several seconds. I'm still not sure, to be honest, exactly how much of the stuff I was suppose to put in a glass.<br /><br />I actually kind of liked the taste. I HATE the taste of fake sugar. It always leaves an aftertaste that I can't take. I had to put a good bit of this stuff in a glass of water to make it slightly bad tasting. It's not overly sweet, which I appreciate. I think others might not like that, though. I prefer my flavorings to be very mild tasting. Others might prefer really sweet, which would not be this one.<br /><br />Overall, if you like mild flavors, give this one a try if you're willing to experiment a bit with now much to put in a glass. If you like really sweet, go with something else.
1743	5	Perfect for College kids, as it only needs water, but... what I never considered was the MENTALITY of my college students... what **I** thought would happen was for many small cakes be made out of the 5-lb mix.<br /><br />well... the box on its side has instructions on how to make the mix.  the entire mix in one BIG cake.  and that is what they did.  one HUGE cake, and one monstrous mess in one trashed out kitchen with one very sad (but wiser) mom shaking her head.<br /><br />Great things about this mix:  1.  only needs water added, all other ingredients are already in the mix.  2.  you can make any size cake you want and save the balance of the mix for future baking endeavors.  3.  it bakes up into a very light, yet moist cake.<br /><br />Things to remember:  1.  the bag inside the box is NOT resealable, so you will need to find some way to seal a container or large ziplock baggies to keep the balance of the mix fresh and bug-free.  2.  college kids will make the whole cake mix at one time and dive right in.  :)
1744	4	When it comes down to so many Americans, they are right now skipping going to Starbucks to get their favorite flavor of coffee and lattes, and having them right at home. Fortunately, Melitta knows that feeling with their coffees, and make them well from the heart. Their French Vanilla is a delightful tast that just melts your heart away. It is delicious after the first cup, and just everlasting. My one and only gripe with Melitta though is that with their ground coffees is that they are very hard to open the cans, considering you'd have to use a regular can opener to get them open, rather than peel the top off from Folgers or Maxwell House. That definitely is the only thing that is not only frustrarting, but can easily cause the consumer to break the can. Still, the taste is great and if you want a nice soulfully delightful cup of joe, Melitta can take you there.<br /><br />Price: B-<br /><br />Taste: A-<br /><br />Convience: B-<br /><br />Overall: B
1745	5	I have tried several types of hot chocolate since purchasing my Keurig and this is by far the one I enjoy the most.  I have it shipped every month so that I don't worry about running out!!!
1746	5	My cat has had problems with struvite crystals so we had been using Royal Canin for several years.  He loved that food and the struvite crystals became a non-issue. I decided to try this food at the urging of my sister and I am so glad I did. My cat did not like this food at first.  I mixed it with his old food and he would pick out the old food and leave the Instinct.  However, he has slowly gotten used to it and I have realized through reading other reviews and getting more information that he doesn't need to eat as much when he's on this food because it's so nutritionally dense. My cat hasn't had any issues with struvite crystals because the formula is grain free and grain is a major factor in struvite formation.  The best part about switching to this food is that my cat has new life.  He is running, jumping, and playing like he's a kitten.  He has so much energy and his coat looks 100% better than it did before we switched.  Yes, it took him awhile to get used to the new flavor but it has been well worth it to transition to Instinct.  It is superior to any other food we've tried.  If your cat doesn't like it just give it some time or try a different flavor.  If you love your cat and want to give him the best nutrition then try this food.
1747	4	Although it comes down to a matter of taste, I suppose, my kids (all four of them) didn't like these as much as the apple blueberry ones. They still ate them, but weren't as big of fans on our trips to the beach in recent 90 degree weather. I definitely recommend refrigerating them before serving, as they liked them better cold than room temperature, but I think they would still have eaten them. They are great for a clean, healthy-ish snack for field trips and I will surely buy them again for lunches and such, as they are a nice pantry staple when we are out of fresh fruits.
1748	5	I sent the truffles as Christmas gifts in 2007, and the reviews were top of the line. Everyone loved them, even those who said I shouldn't have sent them so many! I tasted them too, and they were delicious.
1749	5	These are the only treats these outdoor cats will eat ,of course they weigh  about 20 lbs.each and Im not sure if its the treats or they are just lazy. This is all we buy and Amazon does a great job of geting them to us.
1750	5	I really enjoyed this product.  The Mojito flavor was just right.  There was no bad or bitter aftertaste.  The drink is good chilled or poured over ice.
1751	5	I love these cookies and the price is decent, but if the temperature is above 80 degrees, they will melt together.
1752	5	This egg protein is great!<br />First off, it is sweetened with Stevia, a natural herb, and not some artificial sweetener like aspartame or sucralose.<br />Next, it is very easy on the stomach, even whey without lactose is a lot harder on my digestion system it seems.<br />It tastes good, mixes well, and is a good value.<br />I bought all 3 flavors and found I prefer the vanilla.<br />Goes really well with some almond milk and blueberries.<br />I'm glad I've found a pure protein source that is dairy and soy free.
1753	4	So I'm a pretty big fan of GT Dave's Trilogy and Synergy lines of bottled kombucha, and, as anybody familiar with true, natural kombucha knows, it has to be kept refrigerated, or else so-called bad things could happen (like continued fermentation).  This brand does not need refrigeration, as it has gone through some sort of processing (pasteurization perhaps, yeast removal, I don't know really) to negate the need for storage and shipping complications.  Of course, the downside is that health benefits attributed to natural kombucha are somewhat lost here, since processing kinda tends to that, but it still contains bacteria cultures (at least according to the label), it's still "organic" and most importantly, it still retains that vinegary kick that sort of defines the kombucha taste.  Make no mistake, this product is far sweeter than GT Dave's, 60 calories for an 8.4 ounce can (vs. 60 calories for a 16 oz bottle of GT's ), but it's still got some kombucha-y flavor.  It's perhaps not as "yeasty", and is certainly missing any hint of alcohol from the original fermentation - I'd need a bottle of GT's to compare to be sure - but it goes down nice and easy anyway.  It would be a good way to get into drinking kombucha for someone that isn't used to it yet.<br /><br />So, it's not a replacement for GT's or any other naturally fermented and bottled kombucha product (several come to mind that have pulled from shelves), but it *is* tasty, organic, shelf stable, and convenient, and I like it for that reason.<br /><br />As for the flavor, I've tried two (of many) from this brand now, the "traditional" and the "green tea and lemon".  So far my preference leans to the "green tea and lemon" just because I like the tartness of the lemon.  The "traditional" hints at stereotypical sweet tea, with that kombucha-y vinegar kick, but it's just a little sweet for me.  Of course, it's better to find a sample around town before committing to a case, if possible, at a health-food store, or more progressive grocery chain.  I'll probably order another case of the green tea and lemon when I finish off the first one.
1754	5	My midwife recommended this product, and I drank it throughout my second and third trimesters. My labor was slow, but I experienced nothing you might really call pain (pressure and some discomfort) all the way to 9 centimeters. Then I pushed 3 times and my son was born. I'm not saying for sure that it was the tea...but I didn't have labors like this with my other two.<br />At any rate, it's tasty and not harmful. Just remember to tell your midwife or doctor that you're using it. I still drink it just cause I like it.
1755	3	I bought this product for my mom who has had a violent cough accompanied by phlegm for 10+ years.  She has been told she has acid reflux.  She's tried many drugs and remedies but nothing has eliminated her coughing.  I told her to take 1 tsp/day of Manuka honey and see what happens.  It's been about 3 weeks and she says her cough seems to be getting better but she was taking Prilosec for part of that time so she's not sure if the honey or the drug is working.  Now, she has stopped the Prilosec, and is only taking this product.  Her coughing bouts are much less than they were so it appears that this product is definitely helping.  We're very optimistic.  I would say it's definitely worth a try for acid reflux.
1756	4	I bought this on impulse, the moment I came across it on Amazon-- I had been shopping for Jelly Bellies after not being satisfied with the pricing of bulk beans from brick and mortar/warehouse stores. 10 pounds of beans for $65?  One click and several months later and here I am.  I've had these for months and I've hardly put a dent into them.  I've had to resort to finding creative things to do with them-- like putting handfuls into individual baggies and hiding them throughout the house so I can have "surprise jelly beans" when I'm not expecting it.<br /><br />The only reason I knocked off a star in this review is because these beans literally come in just a cardboard box.  No plastic bag holding the beans, just a bunch of beans sitting in and against cardboard.  There were some small exposed seams and I did have some concern if the beans could be exposed to creepy crawlies. A one cent bag to protect the beans while they are in the box would be appreciated.
1757	3	My wife Linda thought this stuff would make her task easier but oh no it wasn't she had to add more to the mix. Not all that good Lindas mix is far better. oh yes. Unless you like a very very mild season
1758	1	The price is good, size is perfect...but my dog doesn't like them at all. Would not buy again sorry. Not the products fault
1759	4	My wife and I have been using Kitchens of India products for a long time now, and have always been very satisfied. Biryani is one of my favorite dishes, so when I saw this product I had to try it.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about Kitchens of India products is that fact that the ingredients list is all natural, and you can identify every single thing on the list. I'm not someone who eats solely natural or organic products, but I do appreciate it when I am able to do so.<br /><br />The taste of the resulting Biryani you will create using these packets is absolutely outstanding; considering how simple the recipe becomes using this paste, the taste to effort ratio is incredible. I won't lie and say I've never had a better Biryani in a restaurant or homemade by my wife's grandmother, but I can't imagine another product being this easy to use and still tasting anywhere close to as good. The only thing I would warn is that if you follow the exact instructions on the packet, your biryani will be HOT. This is coming from two people who can handle a decent amount of spice, if you use the entire paste packet in your recipe, the resulting outcome is almost unbearably hot to eat.<br /><br />Not a problem though, as there are two very easy options. You can either use HALF (yes, you really will need to cut it down by 50%) of the paste in each packet, mixed with the recommended amount of meat. Or, you can use the whole packet, and just double the amount of meat, and the result is perfect as well. We prefer the latter, as both of us are always left wanting to eat leftovers again the next day!<br /><br />So if you are looking for a great, simple way to make homemade Indian food that is quick enough even for weeknight meals, you will love this Biryani paste (and probably lots of other Kitchens of India products). Just be warned, if you use the whole thing, it will be SPICY.
1760	5	My college age daughter likes this chai tea. She adds milk & a little sugar. I prefer green tea, so the recommendation is hers.
1761	4	Addictively light chips without the fat.  With these larger bags, you do tend to eat half the bag in one sitting without realizing it!
1762	1	I would never buy this cocoa ever again. this was by far the foulest substance to ever cross my lips. DONT BUY THIS<br />no stars
1763	5	This wine was much better than I expected from a $40 wine kit.  I kegged mine and charged it with a little CO2.  It's my wifes favorite
1764	4	I love the idea of bacon anything...I bought this for my kids for Christmas and they all got a laugh out of it, but none of them liked the taste. I would still recommend for the novelty, but don't expect that it's gonna taste good.
1765	5	These k-cups are cheap because they don't have the plastic cup base. That means that they don't keep as long, but frankly I haven't had an issue with that. They are delivered in 12-pack bags with most of the air pushed out of a valve. I immediately put them in the freezer except for the current 12 I'm using. I drink about 3 cups a day, and keep the open k-cups in a sealed plastic bag on a shelf. Quality has not degraded to a point where I've even noticed.<br /><br />A few notes:<br />- This is apparently the same bean mix they use in Fog Chaser, but it clearly is a lighter roast. I find it suits my taste preferences better than Fog Chaser, and my understanding is that a lighter roast means more caffeine.<br />- A normal k-cup has a plastic base, the filter basket with the grounds, a plastic ring to hold the basket in place, and a metal foil seal. These are significantly cheaper in part because they don't have that cup. This leads to my storing the 12-packs in the freezer until I need them. I would suggest trying the ones with the full cup first to figure out if this (or Fog Chaser) can be your regular coffee, and if so, definitely get these.<br />- One issue that I don't care about, but others do, is that the cup isn't there to catch the really fine grounds. You will end up with some grounds at the bottom of your cup. If that bugs you, don't get these. The grounds are very fine and don't affect the taste of the coffee.<br /><br />Oh, the taste: it's a medium roast perhaps on the lighter side of the spectrum. If you like a darker roast (e.g., that popular coffee chain that burns their beans to ashes, IMHO),  then you'll like Fog Chaser more probably. The acidity and bitterness are well-balanced. I drink my coffee straight black, which is how I like it; if I kept the same taste but switched to cream and/or sugar, I would go with Fog Chaser. The thing I like about this blend/roast is that it has excellent flavor with a hint of nuttiness. It doesn't have a ton of body, IMHO, but that's just what I've found to be the case with the Keurig. I'm thinking about the K2, but I'll wait for more pod choices.<br /><br />Finally, I'll be honest, I don't buy these for eco reasons; I'm too picky about my coffee. However, there is less waste and, if I was the sort of person to compost, it would be very easy to separate the basket from the ring and compost the grounds.
1766	5	This is a terrific product and about as healthy as you can get.<br /><br />If you're a bit ambitious you can also make your own brown rice flour at a much lower price by grinding up uncooked brown rice in a powerful blender (like a Vitamix in the dry container) until the right consistency. Use the pulse mode, however, so it doesn't get hot during the grinding process.  Can do the same with oats, white rice, whole wheat, tapioca, etc.
1767	5	I am so addicted to the ginger crystals. The health foodr store in my neigborhood discontiued this product. I was so thrilled to find the exact item, and a better quality online. The ginger in the online version is alot stronger than the crystals that I purchased. I like to blend it with a nice berry tea or I will add lemon and a little tequila when I have a cold.
1768	1	This product, while possibly satisfactory for some, was not as represented.  I had searched for 100% Dutch process cocoa, and that was what I thought I was gettuing.  Wrong!  This  product is a blend of natural and Dutch process cocoas.  The description is misleading.  I have written a letter to Customer Service about this, but my hopes for a good result are not high.  Apparently because this a food item, even though none of the cans was opened, it is not a returnable item.  I'm not a happy camper!
1769	4	This is the only veggie jerquee my local grocery store carries and is a good substitute for when I don't feel like ordering my favorite(stonewalls) online.<br />I like the flavor and the texture but I always need scissors to open the package and I hate the thought of my germy scissors touching my food.<br />Once you finally open it, it's hard to really get a good bite because it is very stringy and full of sauce, you usually end up with half the product in one bite just so you don't get sauce all over your hands and mouth.<br />I often get it stuck in my teeth too, which is annoying when I'm at work without dental floss.<br />I think they are redesigning the package so hopefully it will be easier to eat soon. They could work on the price too, $1.29 at the store for 2 bites is a bit ridiculous!
1770	5	I am very pleased with the product, the service and the price.  The Guar Gum is great to use to thicken smoothies and low in calories.
1771	5	Just like I remember from ye olde times: freakin delicious.<br />Only one catch: it. Goes. Too fast.<br />If you ever loved this as a kid, tryit again for the first time.
1772	5	I am very pleased with this decaf Earl Grey.  The tea leaves do have an odd smell - it almost smells like it is green tea - but the flavor is very nice.<br /><br />ETA: My first bag of this tea lasted me about a year, and I just ordered another bag in February 2011. This bag is different - there is a very strong citrus scent from the leaves, which is odd, but I think the flavor is even better than last year's bag. I upgraded my rating from 4 to 5 stars.
1773	5	We're vegans and eat very healthy, but occasionally crave some ramen too - most ramen out there contains too much sodium and all sorts of tasty but unhealthy ingredients in the spice packet.  Not this one - though yes, the taste is pleasantly mild, it's not as strong as you may be used to from generic brands - it's also organic and much better for you.  And if you like to work with what you've got at home to add some flavor, you can easily add a veggie or your own seaweed while it's cooking to take things up a notch.  We even put some garlicky kale in last night and it was delicious.
1774	5	It's what i expected. I like it a lot. It's tart and tangy. I drink a swallow and chase it down with a drink of water. I know it's good for me and I feel better when I drink it. I've never tried a different brand, but I'd definitely buy this again when my bottle is empty.
1775	2	It's hard to review this tea because each bag I've steeped has been like a whole different experience... one was smooth and flavorful, another weak, and still another bitter.  Nothing's changing in my process except the tea bags!  Perhaps I just got a bad batch, but I cannot in good conscience recommend this product.
1776	5	I used this fondant to create dice to add to cupcakes for a Bunko for the Cure fundraiser.  They came out awesome and were a huge hit!  The fondant color was vibrant (matched the real dice that we used to play with.  This fondant is so incredibly easy to work with and it tasted delicious.  Even the non-fondant lovers in the crowd (including me) loved the taste! I look forward to using this product again....and again....and again!
1777	5	So wonderful to have the coffee i grew up with. My family has drunk RT coffee for 3 generations. I moved to Oklahoma and never thought i would have this daily treat.<br />Thanks Amazon for making my childhood favorite happen everyday.Good price and fast shipments
1778	5	Love the extra dark type. I like to keep packets on hand at work, the deli coffees are too weak for me. VIA pack, 8 oz of water even + ~2 oz creamer still makes a nice strong cup. Found here on Amazon for 62 cents per pack, grocery had for $1. $20 savings for a month's supply!
1779	5	I was worried when I purchased this since there were so many other brands to choose from.  I made a glass this morning and WOW it is perfect!  What a great deal and great taste!  This bag will last a long time, it is actual loose tea with the spices and VERY good quality.  I will definitely be buying more of this stuff!!  I am using my french press coffee pot to brew and filter the tea and it works perfectly!
1780	3	So many brews, so little time.  First, like with many of the cheaper brands, the bag doesn't open easily- tends to rip. It, of course, has little flaps to close it up.<br /><br />Once opened, it produces a deep and rich smell- for those who simply enjoy, can I say, the bouquet of coffee.  Tastewise-what can I say?  People prefer different brands for different reasons.  For the most part, one knows immediately if this cup suits them. This one is nothing stellar at least not in our house.  At least it wasn't bitter or burnt tasting.<br /><br />Definitely will drink if nothing else left in cupboard.  Not bad, but simply, not our cup of coffee.
1781	4	I haven't used this product too much yet, but I got it to write on candy melts.  The wilton brand I bought before was horrible.  These are so much better.  For writing on candy melts, get this product, not the wilton food writers.
1782	4	I have been eating and loving these since I was a kid. They are still a great tasting treat for me.
1783	5	Absolutely love this wet food as a compliment to our Fromm's Dry food that we feed our two dogs. Quality ingredients and it's so tasty that our girls freak out and start to cry as soon as we open the can (they did not do that with previous wet food)!
1784	5	I recently heard about the great benefits of coconut oil and was wanting to give it a try.  I first bought a small jar from my local Walmart.  It had no flavor whatsoever and I felt like I was missing something.  Come to find out I needed Organic, Cold Pressed, Extra Virgin coconut oil.  The ones I found were not.  It was suppose to have a delicious coconut smell and light flavor.  I came to Amazon because I appreciate being able to read reviews of buyers before actually spending my money on an item.  Nutiva is an exceptional product.  Exactly what I was looking for. I am now addicted to toast with coconut oil(in place of butter) and jelly.  OMG!  I can't get enough.  I crave it every morning.  I was scared of all the saturated fats until I learned that not all saturated fats are bad for you (contrary to popular beliefs).  The studies that have been done on people for lowering the bad cholesterol and other benefits sold me. I would compare it to how the medical profession said eggs were bad for you and now they say they are good for you.  I am almost out and am definitely buying more.  Maybe the smaller containers though just to make it easier to reach the bottom with my teaspoon. Great product!
1785	5	I really can't believe these are sugar-free they taste just like the originals I remember as a kid.<br />Really Yummy.
1786	5	A great tasting treat the cockers go crazy for. As soon as I grab the bag they come a running.
1787	4	This product does have a good melon flavor. When you taste it you can identify it as melon. The bottle is large and very tall (12.5 inches) so I had to re-adjust my shelves for it. It is made in France and contains melon juice, but it also has artificial flavor and color on the label.
1788	2	This was on super discount when I got it so it was only a waste of like $3 but nowhere does it say that it's actually some super disgusting, highly potent mutant cousin of Earl Grey tea. I bought it thinking it was straight black Ceylon tea. No such luck and now I have nothing to make fermented kombucha with. Utter disappointment and I love Earl Grey!
1789	5	Paul Newman gave many gifts to the world.  Lying on his deathbed with images of his life flickering before his fading vision...The Hustler, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Butch Cassidy, numerous salad dressings...I like to think he gave a final goodbye to the prunes before the clammy fingers of fate smothered him in the eternal dark moment of death's sweet release.  Paul Newman suffered to bring the prunes to us and ultimately paid the ultimate price for it; a price far greater than the list price of $29.40 + shipping, and he did it with dignity.
1790	5	I have tried many different beef jerky products and Wild Ride Beef Jerky is the best I have ever tried.  It is the most tender beef jerky I have ever had, their is no MSG or Nitrites and the flavor is great I have tried the Hickory, Pepper & Teriyaki -- I will buy Wild Ride again...
1791	2	Product seems ok but, is shipped in a flimsy cellophane bag that cannot be reclosed.  (Note that the photograph of the product appears to show the rim of a jar, but the ad intentionally avoids a description of the packaging.)  A cheap jar with a screw on lid would not have added much to the price.
1792	1	Found cheaper pricing at a couple of local stores and 2 of the 6 tubs had busted tops from good 'ol UPS doing a number on them.  I will just buy from local supermarket from now on.
1793	5	Awesome deal on quality product! Would recommend to anyone!!!  I loved the fact that this was shipped to my home, and quickly too!  Skippy is a good tasting, great value peanut butter.  Would love to have this ordered again!
1794	4	Solidly made, good for dogs with a history of easily destroying toys.  My dog prefers his regular nylabone more than the Galileo but this one is definately more bullet-proof.  The most indestructible toy we've owned...and that's saying something.
1795	5	I like the taste of dried fruit, but usually I feel as if I'm giving my jaws a workout whenever I eat some. These pears are soft, almost creamy in consistency, and sweet beyond belief. I had intended to chop the pears and use them in baked goods, but I guess I have to wait for the next batch to do that!
1796	5	I am a huge coffee drinker and Caribou has become my favorite coffee. It is bold but not bitter. I purchase this product every month.
1797	5	I use in my refillable keurig  k-cup and it brews the perfect cup of rooibos. This is the best quality loose rooibos I've purchased. Will definitely be a regular order going forward.
1798	5	Stash Licorice Spice tea is so soothing. I can't always drink a caffenated tea, although I love it. Before I have anything in my stomach, Licorice tea is wonderful and soothing. I can't find it anywhere else but at Amazon. It does not have a strong licorice flavor, which I know some people don't care for.
1799	4	My husband and I both enjoyed this coffee, it was smooth and easy to drink. I especially enjoyed it with a little bit of almond milk, it was perfect. I'm usually not much of a coffee drinker, I need it sweet or extremely smooth, so I was happy to find that this coffee was not as bitter as most. For those who need a nice, fresh easy coffee, I think this is perfect.<br /><br />It's important to note that these packets are for pod brewers, not your regular 8-10 cup coffee maker. They come conveniently packaged and my first thought upon opening them was that they're perfect for the small business! Hotels, bed & breakfasts, small offices, etc would all love this style of coffee that is convenient and individually made. I would definitely recommend it for someone in need of a good coffee for use at their small business. But also if you're a 1-cup a day sort of drinker, or someone who occasionally likes to make a very small pot of coffee--this is the perfect set up for you!
1800	5	Having grown up eating lots of canned processed crap (Campbell's soups, boxed mac & cheese, Chef-Boy-R-Dee pasta, etc.), I sometimes still find myself hankering for the "delights" of youth--even though I'm now an organic gardening, veggie loving, fresh-and-healthy eating gal. This is where a product like Annie's P'sghetti Loops comes in!<br /><br />Obviously by the name, this is intended for kids. (And I'm sure kids would love them.) But I've happily eaten this for years as an adult, and I always purchase them by the case to save money when I can. Sure, the noodles are soft and somewhat bland--they ARE canned, after all!--but those little soy meatballs have an appealing, slightly chewy-crumbly texture, and the tomato sauce has that touch of sweetness that is reminiscent of those mainstream brands...all of which adds up to make me a happy camper indeed!<br /><br />What I like even better is that this product is natural and organic--no fields of wheat were sprayed with petroleum-based chemicals to make it, which means the beneficial insects are still alive and the groundwater isn't contaminated. ("Conventional" agriculture dumps 3.5 pounds of pesticides PER PERSON on U.S. land; 20% of these approved pesticides are listed as carcinogens by the EPA. Not very appetizing, huh?)<br /><br />Annie's has been promoting organic foods for years, unlike so many newcomers to the "green" trend. (Although better late than never, I suppose.) While I'm not a fan of ALL of her products (the boxed mac & cheese has never won me over), there are others, like these P'sghetti Loops with "meat"balls, that are satisfying to both my palate and my conscience.<br /><br />Sure, it'd be even better if I made homemade pasta (and I often do), but for those times when I want something quick and convenient, this totally fills the bill. :-)
1801	1	This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.
1802	5	I have been trying to eat better. And I have been going on photo walks. I find that I need something with me in case I get hungry. Fruit doesn't travel well. Granola bars do well in my bag. But chewy bars get too sticky. And most crunchy granola bars are so hard I am always worried I would lose a tooth or two. I saw these at Nutrition S'mart yesterday and picked them up. I tried one before I got home. They have a great crunch, not too hard, and a wonderful flavor. Now I want to try the other flavors but my local Nutrition S'mart only had 2.
1803	5	I foster cats for a local animal rescue and have never met any cat or kitten that doesn't LOVE Temptations. I am never without them!
1804	1	I tried this despite the poor reviews because I really miss pancakes and with the low cost, thought, what the heck. But I took one bite and had to throw it away. I thought it would have a nice sugary flavor but it just tasted gross. I can't even describe it. Synthetic, maybe? Also, the serving sizes they list on the box are a joke. For example, the box says that 1/4 of mix with 3 tbs of water will make four pancakes. Maybe four nickel-size pancakes. MAYBE. I had to use a whole cup--which probably left only about a cup left in the entire boxI--just to get a pancake a little bigger than a saucer. know this is cheap but do yourself a favor and save your money. Just search online for recipe and do it yourself (you can buy zero sodium baking powder and lower sodium salt).
1805	5	We were familiar with the Snapea Crisps from a local retailer and were happy to find the product on Amazon.  We selected the automatic reorder service which gives free shipping and a discount on the product.  The Snapea Crisps have come twice so far and were fresh on both occasions and at a lower cost than the local supplier.  The automatic reorder feature is great.  I receive an email a few days before the shipment detailing the order information and the total cost.  This gives me plenty of time to decline the order if I so chose.  The email includes handy links to cancel the shipment or to edit the auto-order options.  I couldn't be more pleased with the product or the process.  I would recommend to others.
1806	4	We've enjoyed this popcorn every bit as much if not more than the Movie Theater Popcorn.  It's light and fluffy - tender - and delicious.  I think we enjoy it a bit more because we know there is no "palm" oil or coconut oil in it - we can control what oils we add or leave out.  It works well with the popper - in fact just last night we had a popper full of this corn and followed it with the other because we had purchased so much of the other - we enjoyed this more.
1807	4	I found this coffee flavorful and bold.  I didn't experience bitterness.<br /><br />For reference purposes my in store drink is a Starbucks Americano.<br /><br />My favorite k-cups are:<br />Starbucks French Roast<br />Starbucks Caffe Verona<br />Starbucks Pike Place Roast<br />Green Mountain Xtra Bold Sumatran Reserve<br />Green Mountain Double Black Diamond<br />Green Mountain Revv<br />Green Mountain Dark Magic<br /><br />Other k-cups I've tried:  Coffee People Jet Fuel ,Green Mountain Dark Magic Decaf, Emeril Jazzed up Decaf, Starbucks Caffe Verona, Coffee People Black Tiger,  Starbucks House Blend, Starbucks Breakfast Blend, Starbucks Sumatra, Wolfgang Puck French Roast, Green Mountain Lake and Lodge, Green Mountain French Roast, Caribou Mahogony, Wolfgang Puck Sumatra Kopi Raya, Emeril Big Easy Bold
1808	3	I ordered this for my husband.  He likes it better than any other artificial sweetner for his coffee.  It is easy to use and lasts a long time.
1809	2	The CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY (clean and refresh anti-dandruff)...<br /><br />Both this product and "Head & Shoulders" use the SAME active ingredient.  The difference is this product claims the inclusion of ginseng, mint, and tea tree ("Bio Nutrium 10").<br /><br />Is the extra two dollars difference (at the time of this review) worth it?  It depends on you.<br /><br />IMPRESSIONS: The product had leaked (minor) in shipping.  The shampoo has a light fragrance.  I personally like the fragrance.  The product felt "greasy" to the touch (closer to conditioner) and does not lather (compared to Head & Shoulders).<br /><br />RESULT: The hair did not have the "hold" I'm used to from "Head & Shoulders"(does not have conditioner). It also made my scalp itch (noticeable and annoying).<br /><br />I'd recommend a small sampling before purchasing.
1810	5	This coffee has great flavor.  I really love all of the Caribou coffee's that I've tried. Will continue to buy this coffee.
1811	3	Cereal is very nutritious by the label and my wife and her sister like it, but the flavor of flax is very intense.
1812	5	I love Green Tea Gum. I couldn't find it in stores anymore. I was very happy when I found it on Amazon.com.<br />What a Great Deal for a Great Product.
1813	5	I purchased the syrup in order to fulfill the requirements of the Master Cleanse.  The cleanse is done at a minimum of 10 days which is how long I chose to do it.  The determining factor in my purchase of Now 640z Grade B maple syrup was the price!  $28.00 for a 640z bottle of Pure (Grade B) Maple Syrup is awesome!  It was shipped & received very quickly which made me even more satisfied!  Thanks Amazon for being on top of your business!<br />B.  Dague
1814	4	My husband loves these cookies. We receive a shipment monthly and each shipment has been packed differently. Today we received pack of 4 which were shrink wrapped together and left in box to rattle around during shipment. We opened one package and many of the cookies are crumbled and I suspect the same to be said of those in other 3 packages. I hope someone from Amazon reads these comments and takes corrective action. I can't find these in any stores in Georgia.
1815	4	So far its so good. Used it at the beach, the zoo and just in the year while the kids play at night.
1816	5	I have a German Shepard that is allergic to chicken and turkey.  Finding treats without poultry is very difficult, let alone finding treats big enough for his 86lb mouth.  These big square treats satisfy even my chihuahua who eats the scraps that drop when the shepard devoures them.  Definately will purchase again.  Can get them at Petsmart also.  Very satisfied with these treats.
1817	5	Tasty breakfast and tasty snack anytime.  This satisfies my craving for something sweet.  I pour low-fat plain Kefir on the granola and it sort of like a parfait.  A bit sweet and crunchy.  Addicted to it!
1818	5	I've been using this stuff for over a year now, probably have gone through six bottles.  I use them solely in Smoothies. I make smoothies every day instead of one of my meals using super food powders Spirulina, Wheatgrass, Chlorella, Superfood Greens, Maca, and bananas, apples, grapes or cantaloupe in season, always add parsley and sometimes other veggies without stems, almonds and pumpkin seeds, recently stopped using flax seeds, a long squirt of Hemp Seed Oil, two heaping teaspoons of Coconut Oil, and couple spoons of Xylitol in place of sugar.  Add plenty of water and blend until smooth.<br />This makes you lose weight and keeps it off. My frayed vertebre is feeling much stronger since last year, and now with ten minutes of exercise each day plus my 2 mile walks 4x a week, at 70 years old I'm feeling better than I have in years, and the bout of sciatica that hit me two years ago is practically gone except for a minor residue - I'm actually healing, my body is improving, rejuvenating.  No drugs thank you, they only mask your symptoms but keep you deteriorating without you noticing until it's too late.<br />Hemp seed oil is an excellent product. It's high in Omega 3 and 6 fatty acid in best ratio available so it says.  I like the squeeze bottle it comes in for smoothies, very convenient.
1819	5	Very pleased with these beans!  Extremely easy and quick to prepare, can adjust consistency to your liking.  These are very good as they come, but you can spice them up if you desire by just throwing in some green chilis, and/or cheese.  Much better tasting and cheaper than refrieds out of the can!
1820	1	I don't like the taste, which perhaps can be expected -- I'm not a big coffee drinker.  However, my daughter, who likes coffee, didn't like it either and says she'd rather go without than drink it again.<br /><br />My expectations were for a very chocolate/raspberry flavored coffee drink.  What I got was a harsh coffee taste with a slight aroma of raspberry and maybe a hint of chocolate.  I didn't taste the raspberry or chocolate at all.
1821	5	This was my second purchase. Watching carbs, I look for snacks that are high protein with low or no sugars. Tiring of nuts all the time I tired these a couple months ago. Very surprised, they taste good with a bit of spice kick. Recalling that most convenience store sticks were dry or greasy or blah tasting, it was nice to snack on these. They are not the long sticks but a nice size at about 6 inches. Wrapped individually and easy to open. Great item to grab when looking for a quick munch.
1822	5	The Blue Diamond Jalapeno Smokehouse Almonds are great tasting, with a strong smoky flavor and a nice jalapeno bite. These have a decent amount of spicy heat to them, but it isn't too overpowering. My wife picked these up for a long road trip and they were the first snack to get finished up.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
1823	4	I have been looking for a decent-tasting meal replacement drink for MONTHS. The healthiest ones taste like liquid grass and the best tasting ones aren't at all healthy.<br />This hits somewhere in-between healthy-wise but tastes GREAT! I found it while shopping at whole foods (in L.A.) they were giving out samples and, after tasting both vanilla and chocolate, I walked away with four boxes of each.<br />I love that it's organic and doesn't use soy-based protein (my soy-allergic son can drink it too!). I love the flavor and the natural, whole grain sweetener. No chalky taste or aftertaste from splenda or any of that other fake garbage.<br /><br />Only reason it's not 5 stars--could have used a little more fruits and veggies in the blend. And at least a couple of grams more fiber. I would have liked a higher vitamin profile. But this way you COULD drink 2/day and not worry about OD'ing on Vitamin A. Lol<br /><br />Great as an after-workout protein boost with a salad or healthy, whole grain snack (multi-grain tortilla chips and hummus?)<br />;)<br /><br />So glad I found it.
1824	5	I have tried most of the Blue Diamond Almond flavors and I have to say this one is my FAVORITE!!!  Once I start eating these almonds, it's hard to stop.  YUMMY!!!
1825	5	I am very impressed with the new Peanut Butter Grahamfuls by Honey Maid, which I just tried for the first time this week. They are fantastic! The portion is quite generous - enough to tame that hunger that gets you between breakfast and lunch. The graham cracker is very crunchy but does not fall apart when you bite into it. The peanut butter filling is thick and satisfying. The overall flavor is very favorable - a tad sweet but not cloying (like so many prepackaged snack bars are). They are very convenient and tidy to eat, and they really help fill the mid-morning hunger void and carry you through to lunch. I'm an adult but these would make a great snack for kids, too - especially after school to carry a kid through until dinner. Pair one with a few apple slices on the side and you've got it made! I really hope these make it on the market and are not discontinued like so many awesome new products tend to be. I'll be buying them every week! Nice work, Honey Maid!!!
1826	5	I really enjoyed this cereal bar. The banana nut bread flavor tasted authentic and not at all like banana flavoring. It was moist and dense, an all around great bar.
1827	5	... look for it to cost around $7-$8 in stores.  I served the recipe for the breaded baked chicken, found on the Rothschild website, to my family at Christmas and it was SOOOOOO good!  Not one complaint!!!  Even my young niece, who is a very picky eater, relished it.  However, this price is outrageous.
1828	5	For those that like these no comment is needed.<br />For those that don't like these, what's wrong with you.<br />I keep these handy around my machine shop for my crew.<br />They all love em, and we do like the salt over the non salt.
1829	5	First, I have to admit that when I was offered this coffee to review, I saw that there were 15 single serve pods and assumed that meant it was for a Keurig. Not so. Apparently there are actual coffeemakers that take these pods. Duh.<br /><br />I received them and had to do a bit of maneuvering to actually USE them, but it worked out fine. I just cut open the pod and put the coffee into one of my reusable Keurig cups and it brewed perfectly. I would imagine they would also work well in the proper machine ;)<br /><br />The coffee itself is a tad more bitter than I normally like, but that's just my own taste. I was able to try the medium roast, so I would personally go for the light, if possible. The flavor is great and I absolutely love that it's Fair Trade Certified, Organic, AND that partial sales are put towards youth soccer programs (kicksforcause.org). I love me some Dunkin Donuts coffee, but they are definitely not fair trade, organic, or donating any of their money.<br /><br />The packaging is perfect for the pods and the box is actually quite attractive.<br /><br />If you have a pod coffeemaker, I would definitely recommend this coffee for it's taste and the company's moral values. If you're buying pods anyways, you might as well make it from a company that offers portions of their money to charity and pays it's workers well!<br /><br />I was impressed!
1830	3	These are really tasty, and make a decent snack, but I've found that they aren't that helpful for running. When I'm doing a long run (10+ miles), they are too sweet, and leave my mouth feeling weird. I had also thought I was ordering the version w/ caffeine, but... appears not (mea culpa). Anyway, lastly, don't seem to give my system much of a boost, so... these go into the snack pile, but I'll not be using them for endurance sports.
1831	5	I bought this as soon as I saw it was available on Amazon. Not sure about the negative reviews from last year.Gum came exactly as advertised. Buy with confidence. Saved over .40 cents a pack compared to buying it at the store.
1832	1	This product tastes okay, but the packaging is ridiculous.  Three hundred 2-cracker cellophane packs were literally thrown into one, big box, with no padding, no partitions, and no expiration dates.  I got these for travel, for lunches to go, and for the convenience of not having remaining crackers go stale.  My family and I can't even enjoy these with spreads or slices of cheese, because all we have are pieces of crackers and crumbs.
1833	4	These are pretty good, but you've gotta realize that each pack is the size of a pack of peanuts.  A lot of the space in each bag is air.  I suppose it is to keep the puffs from breaking.<br /><br />Flavorwise, they're alright.  Cheesy, crunchy, and a bit too salty to eat a lot of.  They're not amazing though.  You could probably get more concentrated flavor by baking your own cheese, but the problem is of course time.  This is very light flavored.
1834	4	Haven't bought this online, just at the supermarket.<br />It's good on homemade pizza. Thick slices are amazing. Just peel off the casing or it warps the pepperoni into a concave dome that pools the fat. And there's TONS of fat.<br /><br />Another tip would be to put the cuts on paper towels then nuke them. Good to get rid of as much grease as you can.<br /><br />LOL at the people eating them "raw" and giving it a negative review. What the hell are you expecting?<br />This isn't a sausage stick to eat like you just bought from a gas station.<br />The fat content is way too high be to eaten plain. Add chunks to a soup, bread, whatever.
1835	4	I first tried fenugreek tea, but even my husband who loves tea said it was nasty.  My OB told me this would slighly help my milk production and she was right.  I wouldn't say a LOT, but probably added an extra feeding or so (4-ish oz) to my day.  I took 2 capsules 3x a day.  The side effect that we heard about (and laughed about) was totally true.  You WILL smell like maple syrup.  It's really odd and funny.  I made all my friends smell me.
1836	5	I love new england clam chowder, and when I can buy a healthy version of it as opposed to the more fattening ones, and have it be just as good if not better, I'm all over it like white on rice! Healthy Choice has come through with another fine product....I will definitely be buying this one again :-)
1837	5	I use these bags for a litter box used by two cats.  I bring my own bags to the grocery store and therefore, have no extra plastic bags to use every morning at the litter box.  I also wanted a green alternative.  I have been using these bags for about a year and will continue using them - they are small in size and good durability.  Depending what you need them for, they may be too small, but they are plenty big for a single cat or dog "event."  In my case, two cats 1x per day does the trick.<br /><br />The quality is quite good and the materials doesn't come off as cheap or weak (otherwise I would not enjoy handling waste).<br /><br />Highly recommended for both value (200 bags) and quality.
1838	1	I bought these as a gift and even though they are funny they taste awful!
1839	3	I consistently get grounds in my cup if I run any extra water thru the disc.<br /><br />I've had them replaced and it still happens... we like to run the disc thru twice and, so far, this is the only disc that has this flaw.<br /><br />We run other teas and coffees with extra water with no issues.<br /><br />We've got our unit since 12/05.
1840	5	I bought this set of tea for my aunt, for a Hanukkah present.  I had already sent her the Numi teapot and tea, so this was to replenish her supply of blooming tea.<br /><br />This set was more colorful.  She shared it with some of her neighbors who come to her house to visit.  They were amazed by the flowering aspect.<br /><br />My aunt loves that I always come up with unique, thoughtful gifts for her.  This one as no exception.
1841	5	Love the hazelnut k cup, its one of my faviourte. Smells good & tastes good. Arrived on time. Will order again soon :)
1842	5	I am on a high protein, low calorie diet.  Jerky is perfect because it has 15gm of protein per serving and only 80 calories.  It is immensely portable and doesn't have to be refrigerated, so I take it with me everywhere.  It is a lifesaver.  I have it on subscribe n save so I always have it available at a price much more reasonable than at the grocery stores. And I love the taste!
1843	3	Either needs more filling or less cookie dough  -- as the dough overpowers the filling, and the dough can really be "heavy" on the stomach.<br /><br />Although all ls forgiven when these Newtons are crumbled a bit, put in a bowl and covered with a generous dollop of Vanilla ice cream.
1844	4	It is the 3.3oz bags just as the picture shows. We have several dairy intolerant in the house and everyone likes it and enjoys it. We have 9 in the household and it is the only popcorn we buy now.
1845	5	These candy bars are like 'all natural' counterparts to Mounds and Almond Joy bars.<br /><br />I recommend them to avoid eating white sugar which is considered by some people to be a poison.<br /><br />Jeff Marzano<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKTG54">SunSpire Coconut Premium Dark Chocolate, 1.75-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5ZGU">Sugar In The Raw/Unrefined, 32-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0961959533">Alkalize or Die: Superior Health Through Proper Alkaline-Acid Balance</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594771545">The Acid-Alkaline Diet for Optimum Health: Restore Your Health by Creating pH Balance in Your Diet</a>
1846	5	I have been a fan of Cheez-It crackers for a long time. We almost always have the cheddar in our pantry and most recently the white cheddar which is very good as well. I was excited to try the mozzarella and I was not dissapointed! They have the same great crunch as the orginal but with a yummy mozzarella taste. I can't wait to see what they come out with next!
1847	5	A friend who recently went gluten free introduced me to this product. I have celiac disease. She told me where to buy it and gave me recipe..I baked the coffee cake last weekend and it was really good. This weekend I just played with it trying my own ideas and it turned out so good!<br />I quit baking years ago when I found that trying to bake gluten free required so much work and was very expensive buying all the different flours...now it is fun to bake again!<br />Recipe:<br />1C suger, 2/3 C butter, (cream together) add 2 eggs, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, (blend) gradualy add 2C Pamela's Baking & Pancake mix.<br /><br />Whip 2 egg whites until stiff peaks form and fold into cake mix..pour in 9X11 baking pan.<br /><br />I also blended 1/2 C applesauce, 3/4 tsp cinnamon, 2 tsp of sugar and 2 tbs light brown sugar. I spooned this on top of the cake mix after spreading gently in pan and bake at 350 for 28 minutes...or until golden brown and the toothpick test comes out clean.
1848	5	My younger son has an allergy to yellow and red dye so can't have much of anything. My older son loves lollipops and I felt so bad giving them to him and not my younger one. I heard about organic lollipops but couldn't find them in our local grocery store. Took a chance on the yummyearth ones and they are REALLY good with no allergic reactions!!!
1849	3	***<br /><br />It's a struggle to devise a way to review this product in a way that makes it interesting to read.  The bars are as advertised (although they were smaller than I expected.<br /><br />Cocoa shows up pretty far down the list of ingredients, although it's difficult to tell exactly how far because there's a mistake in that list, which is that there's an opening parenthesis with no closing parenthesis.<br /><br />Not very interesting so far, right?<br /><br />Well, OK, I can also tell you that when I fully opened up one of the Mylar pouches and laid it on the floor, my cat did eventually lick off the teeny amounts of chocolate that were stuck to it.  He's named Bently Geene because he was born with a tail that's permanently bent into a Z shape, but while that's mildly interesting it has nothing to do with Kellogg's Special K Granola Bar, Chocolate and Peanut Butter, 4.76-Ounce (Pack of 6).<br /><br />I guess what I'm getting at is that this product just isn't all that interesting.  It doesn't disappoint, but it doesn't surprise.  The tastes and textures are acceptable but no more.<br /><br />As has become my practice in Vine reviews, I have tested whether this product performs well in uses for which it was not intended.  As an example, if you spin up one of these bars in a food processor and rub the resulting substance deeply into both sides of your $10 rib-eye steak before searing it, you'll have wasted one otherwise perfectly good $10 rib-eye steak, not to mention one 60% perfect granola bar.<br /><br />And you know how when you want to mark your place in a book you can either dog-ear the page, which I was taught in grade school never to do, or insert a bookmark?  Well, you CAN use one of these bars as a bookmark, but according to a rather stern email I received yesterday from the people at the Johnson County Library you shouldn't.<br /><br />And you know how sometimes in jail you don't have any cigarettes to trade?  Well, according to my experience I calculate these bars to be worth approximately five cigarettes each.  I don't know how other granola bars compare.<br /><br />Finally, if you find yourself training my dog, PheyeG'hdeaux, (pronounced Fido, of course) in the finer points of Fetch, you should use something like a tennis ball or a plush toy.  I don't know about your dog, but with mine if you throw a little chunk of Kellogg's Special K Granola Bar, Chocolate and Peanut Butter, 4.76-Ounce (Pack of 6) and say, "Fetch," he will perform the first half of the procedure perfectly correctly every time, which is to run up to the object to be fetched and take it in his mouth.  Where he falls down EVERY SINGLE TIME SO FAR with these granola bar chunks is in the second half of the procedure, which is where he's supposed to run back to me and deliver the fetched object.  What he does with a tennis ball is just that: He returns it to me in his mouth.  But what he does with chunks of granola bar is to eat them up right there on the spot, which is pretty much the opposite of what I'm shooting for.  Now, your idea of Fetch might be different from mine, but as I see it it's really the second half of the procedure that makes the first half make sense.  Well, anyway, you might regard PheyeG'hdeaux's behavior as an endorsement of these bars' taste, but what we're talking about here is a dog that, if given the chance, will happily eat Bently Geene's poop.<br /><br />On that note I give three stars.<br /><br />***
1850	5	low sodium, great taste, a perfect way to add a little green to an otherwise bland and nutrition-less college meal.
1851	5	These are just delicious. Better than the traditional chip and better for you too! I would recommend that everyone try them. I plan to order more flavors and more and more.
1852	4	ok.  having read the poor reviews, and still wanting a cheap product, i bought this through subscribe and save, and on sale, and it came out to about a dollar per can.  this tastes similar to products i've tried in asian supermarkets that advertise 70% coconut water, and 30% sugar water, essentially, and which taste pretty good, imo.  the ingredients in this product: coconut water, water, coconut meal (the pieces of coconut in the product) sugar, and potassium metabisulfite (preservative)-  130 calories for a 11.8 oz can, 26g sugar. Coca cola has about 150 cal for 12 oz, and 40g sugar, as a comparison.<br /><br />so, if you are drinking this for health, you would do much better with pure coconut water- vita coco-60 cal for 11.2 oz, 15g sugar, which i also think tastes great (sugar adds lots of calories!)  but,if you're drinking this for "fun," (i just like the taste, and coconut water in general feels more hydrating when i drink it),  i figure you're still getting some of the health benefits of the coconut water, even if you're going to drink some sugar water in the process (i put sugar in my coffee and tea...), which i don't mind that much, since i'm not downing this like water or anything.  it also is the only thing my husband will drink, cuz he thinks pure coconut water is bleah.<br /><br />i give it 4 stars, cuz it's good for what it is- a cocktail coconut drink (think cranberry juices)--however, they SHOULD let you know on the website this is a cocktail, though (very BAD advertising omission).  also, many of the cans were dented. but, still, the product is yummy.
1853	3	This old standby coffee delivers old standby taste: workman like and suitable for most tastes. It's got some nuance but not enough to call it outstanding.<br />When it comes to coffee and some the subtle flavors it hides, pre-roasted, mail order types have a tough time standing up against locally fresh roasted and home ground.<br /><br />But, still, I'd drink it.
1854	5	This is the only dog food we trust to feed with.  It is somewhat difficult to find so when I found it on Amazon with such a great shipping rate it was a no-brainer.
1855	4	I have a very finicky eater, especially when it comes to treats (unless, of course, it's from my plate). Luckily, she loves these, and I have to fight her when I'm opening the pouch to give her more.<br /><br />Unfortunately, she wolfs these down with barely a crunch or two, so I don't think I'll see much benefit to her dental health. I'd like the treats to be a bit larger to force her to chew them.
1856	5	I just went to order a box from here and they say 3-6 weeks???????  Ok, now everyone knows how good they are.  We need faster production please :)  These are the best flavor by far.  Can't wait for the Jalapeno to come out.  YUM!!!
1857	5	I have two Siamese kittens who are on a mostly all canned food diet. The Chicken & Salmon formula is one of the foods in their current rotation. They seem to really enjoy eating it, although I wouldn't say it's their favorite food. You can see bits of the ingredients (rice?) in the food, and the texture is not too firm, but certainly more firm than a pate-style food. I have already ordered my second case, and plan to order more in the future. These 5.5 oz cans fit the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000084E66">Petmate Kitty-Kap Can Cover</a> quite well.
1858	2	I've discovered that these have too much salt on the shells and not enough inside. I personally would prefer shelled pumpkin seeds (so that the salt is on the kernel). It would also be less work. =)<br />My wife liked them at first but the 12 pack ended up being too much for her since I wasn't eating them too.
1859	5	These are absolutely the best peanuts ever! This was not my first time buying them. It most definetly won't be the last. They are huge and lightly salted. Very very flavorful.
1860	5	This is the secret to authentic tasting Thai food. Don't bother with those expensive jars of Thai curry paste, one can of this makes two pots whole, I just freeze half the paste in a ziploc bag for another time. This sort of authentic paste is what housewives use in Thailand, I was surprised to see.
1861	5	Absolutely wonderful produce for oven roasting root vegetables.  If you have left-overs they mix well into any soup you are making, just add them to broth or stock and simmer.  For a creme soup, put small batches in your blender.
1862	5	I don't like bitter or strong coffee, so this blend is perfect for me.  It has a nice coffee taste without being too strong.  And it is smooth.  I finally found what I want for my Kuerig.
1863	5	Lucy's is one of the very few baked goods available that omits all the major sources of food intollerances -- gluten, dairy and eggs. More importantly, they are delicious. When we can't find a local source for Lucy's cookies, we always ordered them on-line.
1864	4	I own the original and REALLY like that one, so I decided to give this a try. I don't know if I expected it to be hot, but I wasn't convinced to reorder this one. It has a hint of something I wasn't liking in my bloody mary; maybe it was the peppers? I wouldn't hesitate to reorder the original, though! Great value here, too.
1865	5	My dog loves these treats.  They really help to keep her teeth clean in between brushing. They also help her breath stay fresh and works well as a reward when she is good.
1866	4	I probably would not buy this if I had the chance to. It was an odd, odd, flavor. I really didn't have any steak or meat to add to it so I just made the sauce and ladled it over rice.  It wasn't half bad but rather sweet for a meal for me.<br /><br />I do have some issues with this product.  The first thing is that is is made in Singapore.  Why are we importing food products from another country and does our country check to see if it meets our standards?  Secondly, some of the measurements are not in our form as in 4/5 cup of water. What is 4/5th's???  I know, a little less than a cup, I think. But, since I don't have a 1/5th cup, it was a problem.<br /><br />The serving size is 2 tablespoons.  How can I have a meal with two tablespoons of liquid and meat? Its a mini size.<br /><br />All in all the stuff wasn't that bad but I wouldn't want it again.
1867	5	I have been enjoying Healthy Choice healthy mixers but decided to try thisand did not realize that it was already cooked (no need to add water and cook for 3:30 like the healthy mixers. It has 320 calories and 5g of fat and although it is not marketed as 'diet' or 'healthy' it is inline nutritionally with them. Maybe it is just the shape of the container but it feels like more food too.<br />I don't like spicy food per se but this has a tiny kick to it- nothing crazy spicy.<br />It cooks in 60sec which is awesome too. The pasta may have a slightly more 'dense' (not dente)feel to it if that makes sense but really tastes very fresh. Hope amazon stocks these soon! I found them at my local grocery store but was hoping amazon had them in their subscribe & save offerings...
1868	4	My 98-year-old mother isn't supposed to have much sugar but she needs to get a few extra nutritious calories and likes this. It costs more than the bulk drink mixes but she prefers the variety pack so she doesn't have to drink the same flavor every day and she prefers the packets because they are easy, convenient and she doesn't need to measure anything. I've pretty much tried them all and I like the flavors and mouth feel of Instant Breakfast better than the other drinks. The Instant Breakfast vanilla tastes more like vanilla to me than other brands.
1869	4	<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQE3IC">Slim Jim Meat Sticks, Original, 0.28-Ounce Sticks (Pack of 100)</a><br /><br />These were a great snack to have around.
1870	4	I have tried several of the Stash herbal teas (and other brands), and this is my favorite.  As mentioned by some of the other reviewers, it is a little weak when compared to other brands, but the flavor makes up for that, in my opinion, and I do not always want a strong tea.
1871	5	I feared I'd never eat raisin bread again since I'm trying very hard to be wheat free/gluten free. Although I paid way too much, $6.99 at New Seasons Market in Portland, Oregon, it was worth it. Tried it this morning, and it was like biting into my childhood of eating raisin toast. I made a piece for my husband who avoids my gluten free breads with a "No Thank You, that's for you". He requested a second piece with jelly, making mmmmm.....sounds as he chewed it up. I highly recommend this product. Amazon price is very good if you can use a case.
1872	1	After reading recent article in the New York Times, I was excited to get this food for my finicky kitty.  Purchased the variety pack since I wanted to test out his preference.  He pretty much hated them all; some, he just sniffed, looked at, meowed at me and wouldn't go near.  A few smelled pretty awful as well.
1873	5	Sumatra is my fave flavor of all the Senseo flavors. It's smooth and silky. Love it!
1874	5	CORN PUFFS CEREAL IS ALWAYS FRESH AND CRUNCHY.  A HEALTHY ALTERNATIVE FOR SNACKING ANYTIME.
1875	5	My Scottish Terriers, (3) of them, love these and have been eating these for over a year now.. These treats are healthy, and are always fresh.. Thanks, highly recommend to all.. those dog lovers out there.. Brenda in Okla...
1876	5	These candy bars are THE BOMB!  I could eat them every day.  So addicting.  They came in time for my husband to surprise me at Christmas time.  They are hard to find, so we were happy to find them on Amazon!
1877	3	Hi.  My cats (all 4 of them) didn't react as enthusiastically as I thought they would--they seem to like the other less expensive brands just as much, if not better.<br />  Unless you can get a good deal, don't go on just what the Xtreme title implies. Do, however, try to go organic-your pets don't need the added chemicals.
1878	1	I have used wire gopher traps for decades.  From the description on Amazon, I thought this would be a quality trap.  I was wrong.  In fact, this is the worst trap I have ever bought.  It was totally useless.  I couldn't set the trap because it was either designed poorly or made poorly.  I don't know where this trap was made, but there was zero quality control.  Don't buy this trap.  You will be disappointed.
1879	1	The description on the bag sounded so good that I actually thought something must be wrong with my taste buds. Everyone at work tried them, and we all agreed that they were so bad, it was laughable! What a bitter, nasty aftertaste! The final crime: $5.99 for a a small bag. Had I seen the price, I never would have purchased them. I just ate a few more to reconfirm, and I think I'll go brush my teeth! UGH!
1880	3	The jerky itself is very good quality. The only problem is how much pepper they load onto these pieces. It's so much that it burns my mouth and I can't even taste the jerky, all I can taste is strong pepper. Then it gets into the back of my throat and burns sometimes, or might get stuck in my teeth, all making for a very unpleasant experience!
1881	4	Great for any kind of stuff toy.  Put your toy in the freezer after you've stuffed it to make it a little trickier for your dog to empty it.<br />I don't know that I'd use it with an overweight dog--lots of calories.
1882	5	I don't like spicy foods very much. However when it comes to Sriracha... I will eat it with anything. I usually put it into any Chinese or Thai food for a flavorful boost. I was amazed to find it here on Amazon. It was the first time I discovered food was available on Amazon too. I just thought... "Gosh! I am never leaving my house!". I couldn't find it in any supermarket in my neighborhood so I am very delighted.
1883	5	I am single and live in an apartment with a small galley kitchen.  I do not do much cooking.  I bought these cereal cups originally to take to work for a fast breakfast each morning but I find myself eating this relatively healthy food as a nighttime snack as well.<br /><br />The portion is perfect for an adult to eat.  The convenience of having the sturdy plastic cup as the container cannot be beat.  Tear off paper sealed top, pour milk, eat and throw away.<br /><br />Three weeks later, I have not noticed any staleness in the product, which was my only concern with buying 60 at one time.
1884	5	If you love ginger, as I do, you probably are often disappointed by commercial ginger snap cookies.  Most of them, while promising the bite of ginger, are bland (and often too sweet).  Happily, this is not the case for Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps. The cookies are small and crisp, and the delightful "burn" of real ginger floods your mouth after a few seconds. These also have identifiable chunks of real crystallized ginger which make for a delightful find as you chew.<br /><br />While the "organic" nature is not all that important to me, I did note that the organic ingredients were limited to flour, sugar and palm oil (!).  The ginger itself is not claimed to be organic.<br /><br />My wife and I both found Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps to be among the best non-homemade ginger snaps we had eaten, and the bag's contents quickly disappeared.
1885	5	This salt is seriously fantastic. Lots of folks say there isn't a difference in taste from salt to salt. IMO, not true. Natural salt has minerals going for it that may make it milder than old fashioned sodium chloride. I'm sure all this can be debated.<br /><br />This Maldon (aka English Sea Salt) is super chunky and crunchy. It's milder than normal salt, IMO and tastes great on just about everything. Also, "milder" doesn't mean "add more salt". I like to use this as a finishing salt to add a flavorful crunch to pan fried asparagus with black pepper and garlic, or sprinkle lightly on meats just before serving. Also is perfect for a coarse, dry herb rub for chicken.
1886	5	At about $10 for the 230 warheads itself, this product was the cheapest I could find on the internet. Not only that, but including the fast priority shipping which was about $6 (came in 3 days) the price was still under most of other similar products not including shipping! The colors were all pretty evenly dispersed (unlike the other misleading product on amazon, which only gave mostly lemon warheads) and I got 15 extra! I've only eaten a few so far but they were pretty fresh and no duds or melted ones yet. What more could you ask for!?<br /><br />Basically to sum it up.<br />Pros:<br />-I got 15 extra warheads<br />-even number of each flavor<br />-fresh and sour<br />-fast delivery<br />-cheap as monkeys!<br /><br />Cons:<br />- I got a like 4 empty warheads but how can you call that a con<br />when they gave me 15 extra!<br /><br />Buy from these guys, they know real service.
1887	4	Ok, I admit it. I love sugary breakfast cereals. I always have.  As an adult, I know that they are not always the best choice and try to eat healthier ones. I also want to get my fiber, too. But sometimes you just don't want "twigs and leaves" for breakfast.<br /><br /> Kellogg's Frosted Mini-Wheats Little Bites in Cinnamon Roll Flavor are the whole package. They are smaller than regular mini- wheats, which I really like, but packed with yummy sweet cinnamon flavor-and of course they have the delicious frosted side. They are a great way to get your fiber and are made with whole grain, so you can feel good about feeding them to your family.<br /><br /> Kids will love them, but so will adults. I even eat them straight from the box as a little sweet snack.
1888	1	I always get the white chocolate with mixed nuts that tastes fantastic so this was on sale so I gave it a try. Terrible taste.
1889	5	I know that this is not really a "toy", and it certainly isn't educational, but I didn't want to mar the 5-star rating I gave it!<br />I bought this tin of mints simply because I thought the outside was hilarious! Now people will forever wonder if I'm simply eating a breath mint or taking a much needed stress relief in small white pill form. I love it!!<br />The seller sent my order in record time and I would order from them again.
1890	3	I've ordered beef jerky online several times over the last few years. It's usually overpriced at the store, especially when it comes in 1 to 2 oz. packets. Yes it takes a lot of beef to make beef jerky, but I suspect some of the big players in the industry are making a lot of money.<br /><br />So I try to keep my eye on the smaller outfits which will sell excellent quality jerky for $20 or less per pound. I think my favorite to date has been Tillamook Country Smoker, especially their hot varieties, though jerkyusa is quite good too. I've got a background in jerky which extends beyond what you'll find in the typical grocery or discount store, though I have eaten my share of those brands too.<br /><br />The price on the Golden Valley's Peppered Beef Jerky is excellent, so I figured that I'd give it a shot. I'd say that the two qualities that beef jerky should have are:<br /><br />1)texture (esp. chewability)<br /><br />2)flavor<br /><br />Regarding the texture of this jerky -- this particular batch was not great. Some pieces were better than others, but on average, it was pretty tough. I'd say it's a bit better than the megabrand that you'll find in most grocery stores, but I was expecting a little bit more.<br /><br />The flavor was OK, but nothing special. Overall, I prefer my peppered jerky to have more of a black pepper bite to it - this was definitely on the less seasoned end of the spectrum. In addition, the jerky had a relatively sweet flavor to it that I don't particularly like.<br /><br />I found this particular batch to be relatively average in both texture and flavor. I've decided to give it 3 stars because the price is very reasonable.
1891	5	Tasty product offering a great cup of coffee to get the day started.  I really like the reduced prices with the subscription service that provides the product automatically before we run out.
1892	4	Love these, alot of flavors, But just dont get that many of all the flavors plus a 5lb bag cost 26$ and with this one u get 2.5lbs for 23$ All in All they are really good bought this one because amazon did not have 5lb bags available but see they are available 3/15/09 so I will be buying the larger bag and get twice as many, Last year 5lb bag was 20$  now 26$  must be selling alot ? 17 flavors with alot of packaging or 5 flavors 1 huge bag u cant go wrong best tasting pop or drop around but i still say BUY LARGE more bang for the buck, See ya
1893	5	This almond flour totally MADE my new Danish rice pudding recipe!<br /><br />(Adaptation from Risalamande or Ris a la mande, a traditional Danish holiday rice dessert.) Heat 2 cups water (or skim milk for better taste but more difficulty with sticking to pan), add 3 tablespoons tapioca, 1/2 cup rice, 1/3 cup raisins, 1/2 cup confectioners sugar, 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice, a dash of salt, stir frequently while bringing to gentle boil. Reduce heat to barely a simmer, cook for 45 minutes or until rice is completely tender. Remove from heat and fold in 1/2 cup almond flour. OK to serve with cream or whipped cream but without is lower calorie.<br /><br />Well, it's still a work-in-progress. I tasted the pudding prior to installation of the NOW Foods Almond Flour and it was sort of blah. Then after stirring in the almond flour and !YES! - it gained an absolutely wonderful nutty flavor. The traditional recipe calls for almond slivers but that isn't what I wanted. This is. BTW the traditional recipe also calls for a fruit sauce topping, usually cherry. But I'm working on higher protein, lower carbohydrate diet.<br /><br />I keep this almond flour in the fridge because I know that nuts with their high oil content can go rancid. Please note this shipment of flour tastes really fresh. I'm happy to report that it is dated "Best by 9/11/12". Plenty of time to enjoy its nuttiness.
1894	1	We got our Canned Beef from Amazon around last summer but opened it just now.  It smells vile.  No way we are giving it our dogs.  Not sure if this a variation or do they always smell that bad.  Definitely deleting it from the Subscribe and Save list.
1895	5	My son is almost two and loves these. They are the perfect size for his little hands. It's not recommended for little ones to have more than 6 oz. of juice a day so these are just right. He especially loves the picture of Clifford on the box and even calls it his "puppy juice". I closely watch what he eats and these are a winner.
1896	4	These pork hide bones seem high quality and my dogs like them but they are 75 lb and 87 lb dogs so they don't last more than 15 min per bone. I am not sure that the 20 bones are gonna last in my house long at all. Wish they sold these same bones but much larger sized for large breed dogs. These bones would be perfect for 20 to 40 lb dogs
1897	5	We went to Germany to visit my son who is in the Army.  My daughter drank organgina the whole time we were there.  We came back home, NC and couldn't find it anywhere.  I went to Amazon and there it was.  It was pretty pricy for shipment but so worth it for the smile on my daughter's face.  It's kind of like orange juice but with fizz.  It brought back our vacation to Germany and the wonderful time we had there.  Thanks Amazon for giving me a way to make my daughter's birthday wonderful.  So simple but soooooo good.
1898	4	Beef tendons were recommended by our dog trainer because they are natural, as opposed to rawhides. She says that it's important for dogs to chew 20-30 minutes a day. Our dogs are as picky as could be and won't eat anything.  They love these.  They don't want them all of the time, but when they do, they eat the whole thing.
1899	5	this candy is a classic. chewy peanutbutter flavored taffy filled with peanutbutter. they were very fresh, and the shipping was quick. it was one large bag of individually wrapped candies. i dont think it'd be a very nice presentation for gift giving, but it was fine for what i ordered them for.
1900	5	I am always concerned about sodium, fat, oil and calories.  These Reese Skinless & Boneless sardines are definitely the answer.  What an excellent value, boneless, not unusual, but boneless and skinless, that is another story.  I was buying canned sardines from the .99 Cent store for years, smaller cans, but excellent value.  Once I found these at Amazon this is where I now buy my sardines.  These are an excellent purchase.  I also like the pull tab top.  No can-opener necessary.  I just put them on a plate and add a little mustard and enjoy them.  I highly recommend these.  Actually, I think I am going to have to open a can right now since my mouth is watering.  Oooops, I just checked the pantry and discovered I already ate my last can of sardines, so I am placing my next order now.  If you like sardines, these are a wonderful purchase.
1901	3	This is the first time I ever used this product but cant make up my mind if its helped determine if my cat is diabetic or not.  I followed the directions but the results seemed inconclusive.  Will be taking my cat to the vet.  Id say take the money you wouldve spent on this and use it toward a vet and tests.
1902	4	Gloria Jean's coffee butter toffee is a great tasting product.  It isn't the easiest to find, so I was excited when I found it on Amazon.  The price is average, but considering the availablility who can complain.  I definately would recommend this product.
1903	5	If you like the taste of strawberry Pocky or strawberry Yan Yan, you will like these.  My fiance and I have an  American palette, but we were hooked on Hello Panda ever since he bought the "Milk" (Vanilla) flavor on a whim from the international aisle of a supermarket.<br /><br />They arrive in individual boxes packed in a display box (like at a store).  The individual packaging make them easy to throw in a bag or purse on the go (easy for pacifying fussy kids too!), and the individual outer cardboard package means these creme-filled cookies don't get crushed by your water bottle. :)
1904	3	Even though I knew this was a blend and not 100% Kona, I was still a little disappointed by it (even taking into account my lowered expectations). It is a decent enough coffee, but doesn't really have that smooth Kona flavor that I fell in love with in Hawaii. Honestly, I'd rather just have 100% Kona every once in a while and regular coffee the rest of the time than drink this.
1905	4	I have two adult male cats, one I got as a kitten(Winston)from a co-worker and another I adopted when he was almost two yeas old from a shelter(Peter). I decided to feed them both this brand of cat food, they love it and are both healthy and playful.They both have a very shinny coat too even though they do not like to get brushed.
1906	1	The taste is great but it gave me a terrible migraine from the MSG.  Those who are sensitive beware.  Also, MSG addition is usually a way to fake true flavor.
1907	4	This is not the kind of cereal that would ever be a staple in our house but the kids liked it well enough. The texture is good and doesn't get slimy like Cheerios does after sitting in the milk for a bit. Kind of an airy, crunchy puff. It was sweet enough that the kids enjoyed it without pouring on extra sugar but not so sweet that I couldn't sit down and eat a bowl myself. I would definitely consider buying it on occasion in the future.
1908	5	I put these out for a party and they were more popular then regular crackers.  Great taste , great crunch.
1909	3	I have to use at least two tea bags to make a cup of tea strong enough for the flavor. The tea "smells" good, but it is too light.
1910	5	I really like this hemp protein, like A LOT !!!!!! I make a smoothie and it tastes good and a nutty flavor. I like how you can immediately digest it. I find this is cheaper than a lot of whey proteins. It is very healthy as it is plant based with tons of vitamins. I take 10 chlorella tablets as I am downing my smoothie . The blue/green, green algaes added to my diet have done wonders for my system, I love spirulina and chlorella daily for energy and cleansing, hemp protein just falls in line with a total healthy diet for the body in helping fight disease too. I have been interval training for 4 months now. I do a smoothie with spirulina, flaxseeds ground, hemp protein, coconut oil, banana, and a few frozen strawberries, comes out great. I would highly recommend hemp protein powder for working out, energy, to be regular, protein quickly to muscle after a good workout. I am very satisfied with the switch from whey protein to hemp protein.
1911	5	Gluten free pasta can be less than acceptable- this brand of pasta tastes just like regular pasta. Even my husband, who is not gluten free, loves the taste. I have tried all the styles of their brown rice pasta- Excellent!
1912	5	My baby and toddler both love this baby food. I tasted the food myself, and enjoyed the taste. The other baby foods do not taste so good.
1913	4	I wanted to love these; instead, I merely liked them.  They were upleasantly chewy instead of crisp like the strawberries in my favorite breakfast cereal.  The flavor was okay.  The seal didn't seem to be broken.  I don't know if my tub was typical of the product in general, but I haven't repurchased.
1914	5	Demitri's Bloody Mary Mix is THE best!!!  I make my own tomato juice from my garden (grown organically) and I pickle some of my green beans just for the "Bloody Mary" experience. Good vodka and Dimitri's is all that's needed to make a "Classic Bloody Mary".  The "Extra Horseradish" flavor will really spice up the experience.  Dimitri's is also an excellent marinade for steaks and other meats.
1915	5	I have to admit that those chips are so good that they are highly addictive. I can't stop eating them!!! It's crunchy and seasoned at the right amount of flavor and salt. Just perfect!!! Believe me, some chips are so salty, I can't finish a small bag. But this one... I just keep on eating!
1916	5	Crispy, stands up well to milk.  The corn nuggets are similar to Cap'n Crunch, but not as sweet.  The chocolate inside isn't as much as the carton indicates (as usual with groceries!), but I think if there were more it would overwhelm the rest of it.  Good, good stuff.  I guess if I had kids I would buy this for them as a *treat*, not an actual nutritious breakfast.  It probably has good vitamins and minerals, but I personally can't eat one serving by itself; so I would imagine your average munchkin would have the same difficulty.
1917	5	Fast shipping, I am allergic to dairy and so it is hard to find chocolate thats actually tastes good that I can eat. This is dark chocolate but it is not bitter, the sea salt and almonds make it excellent. I am very pleased with this item :)
1918	5	I love this coffee. I love getting a value on it. I use it everyday in my Keurig coffee maker. Thanks for a great product.
1919	5	Exactly what the product says... dissolves beautifully in cold liquids, and tastes much better than other instant coffees. I've gotten into the habit of adding it directly to some soymilk to make my own iced soy latte. It's on the sweet side (I prefer my coffee to have some bitter notes, this one is all sweet) but since the sugar actually dissolves in cold liquids I'm not complaining too hard. The caffeine level is pretty strong though; I normally have a cup or two of coffee a day and I'm fine, but one packet of this and I was bouncing off the walls. So be warned that while they claim that 1 full packet is a serving, it might not be the case for you.
1920	5	This stuff rocks. I have been a long time fan of the regular Walker's shortbread, but this tastes even better and has a better texture.  If you like their regular shortbread, definitely try it!
1921	2	I've tasted Kung Pao sauce before at various Chinese food restaurants and Kung Pao<br />sauce has a spicy hot taste with a tangy flavor to it.<br />I tried to duplicate the flavor, but it is somewhat time-consuming.<br /><br />So, for those times, when I didn't feel like making my own sauce, I decided<br />to buy it from the bottle.<br /><br />Upon opening up the bottle of sauce, I noticed it was a bit thick and somewhat<br />difficult to smooth it evenly into the vegetables. Then, upon trying the<br />sauce......<br /><br />Ouch! It was pure heat radiating from my mouth and I quickly grabbed a glass<br />of water. If I wanted just hot pepper sauce, I would have bought it.<br />This sauce tasted only of hot peppers.<br /><br />To use this sauce, I had to add honey and vinegar to make it right.<br />If I am going to do that, I just as well make my own.<br /><br />If you like just HOT HOT HOT peppers, this is the sauce for you.
1922	5	<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000D15YQ">Bitter Red</a>Sanbitter (Pellegrino) is at first taste somewhat of a shock but as the flavor settles in it becomes clean and refreshing, an extremely acceptable alternative to an alcoholic aperative. If you must, add a splash of Campari--a take off on a Bellini.
1923	5	We got these for my fiances lab (my lab too thru him) and we use them as occasional treats and for training purposes. For some reason, I thought they'd be bigger than they were, but I'm okay with the size that they are. I read that some people had bugs in their boxes, no bugs here!! Thank goodness!! She likes these treats, but she also eats deer poop in the backyard and anything on the floor, sooo I can't guarantee that the taste is great, but if she eats them, then that's all that matters! LoL. As humans, we'll never know, and I'm not trying them!
1924	5	This is in my opinion by far the best Earl Grey Tea in the Market. Loose tea is significantly better in taste than the tea bags from the same manufacturer. The 6 pack is a great deal.
1925	5	I ordered this sampler pack when I had family coming to visit.  It was a hit with relatives, something from the bold to mellow flavors all available for anyone's interests. Definitely order again when we host a large gathering.
1926	5	This is a fabulous strong coffee. French Roast used to be my favorite but now I have to have my Jet Fuel to wake up.If you are a die hard strong coffee lover you won't be disapointed.One review said to eat first but I drink this on an empty stomach every day and I've never had an issue.Then again I don't mind if my spoon can stand up in my cofee!<br />If I want to sleep at night I don't drink this one after dinner.<br />The 50 count frustration free packaging is the only way to go & the price is great when you choose the auto ship option.
1927	1	My toddler didn't like them at all. Took one gulp and spit it out. The packaging is very cool; great idea to have the snap off lid so you can take it with you on the go. But unfortunately my kid wouldn't eat it. Tried giving them away with no luck. They ended up in the trash.
1928	1	These bread crumbs taste great and bake well.  I'm only able to give this product 1 star because the plastic bag which holds the bread crumbs inside the box, is not sealed completely.  There is a 3/4" gap at the top of the seam that runs up and down the bag.  I ordered this product thru the subscription so I received 3 boxes in one shipment.  All three boxes had the same gap (opening) in the plastic bag. This product needs to be completely sealed to ensure freshness and self-stability.
1929	4	I really love these cookies, which shocked me because I haven't liked most ginger cookies I've tried in my life. These are fresh and crisp. They taste like ginger and the flavor really lasts on the pallet.  They are a bit dry, kind of like biscotti and so they are a great treat to accompany a hot drink.<br /><br />These arrived when I had a stomach bug and they were one of the few things I could get down. I will likely keep these on hand for when I have an upset stomach. They really helped.
1930	4	I like this coffee bean very much - it's smooth and doesn't taste burned like so many coffee beans do. It's my favorite so far, but for me, I'll still keep trying to find "THE ONE."
1931	5	Finally, Colman's mustard sold in the US for a reasonable price! With the subscription service, this is the best mustard in the world for only a little more than your standard grocery mustard. Without it, the six-pack is still reasonably priced- especially compared with ebay and other places where jars are sold for $6 each.<br /><br />This mustard has a nice kick to it and will make anything you eat better.
1932	1	*** I'm going to file an A to Z claim now since Vitacost has already stated they will not take any action for this error as they blame Amazon for misinformation. Per description and picture, a single order should be 6 bottles of Walden Farms Alfredo Pasta Sauce. I placed for orders and expected to receive 24 bottles. Instead, I received 4 bottles. I called Vitacost this morning and spoke to Tekatra who claimed that Vitacost shipped the order as placed by Amazon and Vitacost is not going to be held responsible for misinformation. I certainly feel cheated and would like a full refund or, more preferable, my order completed with the appropriate number of product with free shipping.
1933	4	I lust for Artisana coconut butter. I use it like peanut butter on toast, in oatmeal in the morning, even out of the jar although it's so rich it can be sickening like that (learned the hard way :). Anyway I saw this and it looked like the Artisana at almost half the price. So it's not raw, which is likely why that one is more expensive, but it tastes just as good and makes my wallet happy.<br />To the reviewers who were disappointed - it's definitely NOT like coconut oil, you MUST stir it up, it's a very versatile product to use as a replacement. I foresee ordering more in the future.
1934	5	I've been feeding my six cats Newman's Own organic food for years. Their coats are sleek and healthy. They are healthy. This is certified organic food, not that phony 'all natural' stuff. Terms like 'all natural' and 'human quality' are meaningless. Take a look at what is in regular pet food--google '4 D meat.'<br />This is the one food I really trust.
1935	1	After reading the reviews I thought I'd try these curry noodles. What A Mistake, YUK!
1936	1	Received the candy 3 days after it's expiration date. Disappointed as I expected to received candy that would last a long time.
1937	5	The price was right.  The product great and the vendor did a fantastic job getting the tea to us in a timely fashion.
1938	5	This is great.  Very high quality.  I take the bag and run it through the cuisinart first to get a finer texture, then cook it into 'gallettes' with some yogurt, cottage cheese and an egg - yumm!  Highly recommended.
1939	3	I did not think that the red buffalo chocalate flavored coffee was very flavorful at all. It smells really good, but is definitely lacking in flavor. The coffee tastes good, but it doesn't taste flavored. It is not worth the money.
1940	5	I've fed my little pug this dog food brand all his life. Now as a young adult I feed him 2/3 cups of food daily. He's energetic, happy, and not over weight as pugs tend to get. He also has a very healthy and minimal stool - which is great because he is trained to use a litter box with a "permanent" type doggie pee pad (changed daily) in the bottom. Pudge is always ready to eat so, I try to give mostly healthy treats: maybe a few bites of veggies of my dinner plate and maybe a milk bone a few times a week. But he loves his Wellness and its made him a handsome, healthy little dude
1941	5	Lets face it, when you buy gummies of any kind you already expect them to be...well gummy! I always dreaded it when the kids would toss a box of these fruit snacks into my shopping cart. This is why:<br />1) I knew they would not actually eat all of them and there would be waste.<br />2) I knew I would find the waste stuck to the back seat of my car, or on the bottom of my new socks.<br />3) And I knew there would be conflict the next time they asked me to purchase these for the above reasons.<br /><br />But I caved when they begged, pleaded, and promised to eat all of these. I could not resist them, or the fact that they had angry birds on the box. Admit it folks, this was a great tactic for advertising this product and making it sell. And yes being a parent of small children, I fell for it.<br /><br />But the wonderful thing was the kids actually gobbled them up, every last one, and only shared one pouch with me. They were that good. And I do not care much for the gummy candies. Becasue they are basically the same. They gum, and some you can't chew and the flavor seems to be superficial. Not these. I fell in love with the orange and yellow ones. I am a citrus fan and they were yummy.
1942	5	I am raising three chihuahuas at the moment and as of week-7 they are finally on an all kibble diet of just this and their poops are perfect and their breath has improved and they love it!<br /><br />Buying this off Amazon is definitely the cheapest and easiest way! I did my research on the best food for chihuahuas and what exactly was in each brand and Wellness really is a great choice for you dog. I want mine to live as long as possible and I feel confident they will with a diet of Wellness!
1943	5	Our dog developed diarrhea last fall and we tried several "cures" before finding this product.  We gradually switched her food and by the time I got to 3/4 this and 1/4 old food, her poop had firmed.  She's been on this formula for several months now without any problems.  So nice to find a healthy food that worked for her!
1944	5	The Roland oil cured olives are quite good. They are as good as any oil cured olives that I have made. It is actually pretty easy if you live in a place where olives grow. The term 'oil cured olives' is a bit of a misnomer. This type of olive is actually salt cured not oil cured. First very ripe black olives are picked from the tree, washed and towel dried. They are then packed in a crock in thin layers with kosher salt between each layer. After a few weeks the salt draws all the water out of the olives leaving then looking like small prunes. The next step is to wash the olives very thoroughly to remove most of the salt. Then they are dried with a towel to remove any water. Next place the olives in a bowl and mix with enough good olive oil to coat the olives. They are now ready to eat. They can be kept in the refigerator for many month. So as you can see oil cured olives are actually salt cured. The olive oil is absolutely not a curing agent. It is added to make the olives more palatable. This may explain why, so called 'oil cured olives' are a bit salty for some tastes. As many reviewers have mentinoned the Roland olives can be rinsed, dried with a towel then re-oiled with olive oil. This will produce an olive with much less salt. I frankly think that the Roland oilves aren't too salty and they are a good value when compared to grocery store oil cured olives.
1945	5	Green Mountain "Nantucket Blend" K-Cups make a very good cup of coffee in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQPMHA">Keurig B-40 B40 Elite Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System</a>. This is a very smooth tasting brew that my wife prefers over the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK">Coffee People, Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>] I generally drink in the morning.<br /><br />These are good on both "Small" and "Large" cup settings as well.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
1946	3	We bought a 16 pack and have 13 left.  Of the 3 that we tried, she never once finished a single pouch.  I tried it and was really surprised because it is well seasoned with herbs and spices compared to other things she will eat.  It could be the texture - I don't know.  It's a little mushy, like baby food.  Probably would be better with pasta instead of amaranth, although I appreciate the diversity of grains.  Anyway, I love it, she hates it, so 3 stars.
1947	3	There is an inherent problem with this tea bag style coffee. The bag traps air inside, and so it wants to float on top of the water, which means it doesn't really brew. You can stab at it with a fork, or weigh it down with a spoon, but this still just results in it sitting in the water. There's not water flowing threw it. So the result in my tests was some very weak coffee, and more time spent preparing it than the elaborate packaging warrants. This is no easier than just tossing some grounds in a regular coffee maker with a filter, or using a French Press, and either of those methods will result in a good cup of Joe.<br /><br />The flavor of the coffee was good, hence the 3 stars, but the coffee was weak and trying to brew it was a bother. I would not purchase this product.
1948	4	I made of a great fun food box for my mother in law and auntie. This is one of the things I put in the box. They love the variety and were very happy with it.
1949	5	These are the best chips I have ever tasted.  I usually don't eat chips because they're gawd-awful in every way (taste, oils, artificial stuff, salt, etc.).  From Doritos to all the "healthy" chips I've tried all thru my life, nothing really caught my attention.  I usually could never finish a bag of chips.  I've been a vegetarian for 20 yrs, vegan for the last 5 and RAW/Fruitarian for the last 3 months, so I had given up processed/cooked foods for quite a while now (w/ no regrets).  However, the other day, my mom got me to try these stating they couldn't be too unhealthy when they're chalk full of Flax, Sunflower, Sesame, Brown Rice, Quinoa & Soy!  Now, I'm a RAW/Fruitarian, w/ the exception of these--they're my secret sin.
1950	4	This is my favorite morning tea.  There are better loose leafs out there by a large margin (H&S Tokyo) but for ease of use (I can get hot water from the Keurig & drop these in) it is a solid product.  If I were so rich I didn't have to work I would make loose leaf tea each morning... But I reality when I'm rushed I can drop this In a travel mug full of hit water & be super happy.  Quality to price ratio is solid, I would recommend.
1951	5	Very good healthy choice. My son loved it! When he was younger I used to mix rice cereal with it for additional nutrition.
1952	5	I've been on a diet and I've been looking for items that are high in taste but very low in calories. Furthermore I want them to be vegetarian. Not too long ago, I discovered Tillen farms pickled asparagus spears and found them to be excellent. When I went back for more, I found this jar of Tilllen Farms Crispy Snap Peas on the same shelf about a foot away. Hmmmm. Only 15 calories a serving. I couldn't get away without it. A good choice. The beans are delicious! Nice and fresh tasting with a nice snap when you bite into them. Good flavor. Just the thing I'm looking for.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
1953	5	This is one gluten free item that rates far above pretzels containing gluten. Much better than butter pretzels whlich used to be MY favorite.......just have to remember that I bought them for HIM.
1954	2	My rating does not reflect this product at all.  I give the product a "10".  They are delicious and addicting.  :)  I give the product a low rating due to the seller's price for the product.  I hope people are not actually paying this price.  You can find this same brand in a 32 oz (2-lb) bag at most Costco's for $9.55.  If your Costco does not carry them or your store does not carry them, you can politely ask and your store will likely start.  I was appalled to see this seller has these for such a high price.  I love this product and Amazon, but I will make of note of the seller and never purchase from them.<br /><br />After further review I see Brookside is actually selling this product on Amazon for more than stores charge for the very same product.  I expect more out of a company then to try to swindle their consumers with excessive prices.  I understand the whole concept of saving by buying in bulk, but 100% markup to the direct public seems extreme.
1955	5	My cat loves this cat food so much that we feed it to her as treats. She has a tendency to get underweight so we feed it to her pretty much on demand (which is frequently). I'd recomend it for fussy cats with tooth tartar problems (the chucks are larger than normal cat food and presumably help to clean their teeth when they crunch it). I usually buy the larger size for economy's sake, but this would be a better size to try out on your cat.
1956	5	I just received my Drosera today.  The plant was shipped all the way to Costa Rica and I am happy to inform that the plants made it all the way here just fine!  I just received them today and they are looking great!  I also bought a Venus Fly Trap, btw.<br /><br />Seller shipped the plants together, the very same day and sent an email with tracking # and instructions on how to take care of the plants.  They were shipped to Miami, and from there, they were forwarded to Costa Rica.  It took only 2 days to get them to Miami: super fast shipping!  It then took another 7 days to get to me in Costa Rica, though.  The plants came in a small box with plenty of sphagnum moss, the pots and step by step care instructions that were very easy to follow.<br /><br />I though they would not make it all the way here alive and well, since it is a long trip, but after a bit over a week's wait, they turned up today and they are looking alright.  These guys are really tough!  A few traps on the VFT had gone black, but I guess that is normal and they will grow again.  There are plenty of traps remaining and looking green!  The Droseras came all closed up, with a few flowers buds already.  I'll post pics as soon as it open up!<br /><br />Joel followed up with me a few days later to make sure I got the plants.  I contacted Joel to ask a few questions about specific care instructions since I'll be growing my plants in the tropics and he replied immediately and has kept in touch.  Forget about buying growing from seed (I tried that too and didn't work, plus it will take years before you get a plant the size of these).  Save your time and buy directly from this seller!
1957	5	I bought a 10 pack of this snow cone syrup for my grandchildren & they just love it. The taste is great & it's nice having it already to go, no mixing. I would/will be buying from them again.
1958	5	This is my dogs favorite treat.  Little does he know that there is medicine hidden in them.  Whenever I start putting the pill in the "pocket", he gets really excited.  Alot more so than his other treats.
1959	5	Very nice tea. Not too flowery, I usually get two cups from one tea bag. Easy to drink and very relaxing. Excellent value for 100 tea bags. I have reordered this several times
1960	5	Slop some of this delicious sauce on a Philly cheese-steak and you'll be pure heaven.  I regret I didn't buy a handle of it.
1961	5	With an ingredient list that includes barley, lamb, carrots, and apples (all organic), and a nice thick size, this makes my knucklehead happy. He's a mutt of mixed fox hound and beagle blood and just this morning he coughed up a Brillo pad when we were out for a walk, so take that into consideration if you wish. He has experienced no issues on the other end either, if you get my drift. If you are somewhat conscientious about what you feed your dog, you can't go wrong with these treats.
1962	5	THIS WAS DELICIOUS I LOVE HOT CHOCOLATE BUT THE WHITE HOT CHOCOLATE WAS OUT OF SIGHT.I WOULD RECOMMENT IT TO EVERYONE.
1963	3	I really like Chai tea,  but this Twinings is so-so.  It is very weak chai,  so I use two or three bags per cup (12oz cup).  The minty after taste is not to my liking either.  The Stash Chai is much better imo.
1964	5	This cereal is my staple now for breakfast, only I put a little twist on it. I miss one box with an equal amount of old-fashioned oatmeal and cook it like oatmeal. I just add some fruit when I start the boil and it is a wonderful, hearty breakfast that holds me and my husband until lunch. It is healthy and complex which equals a good way to start the day. I highly recommend it! Occasionally can be found at the store, but I get the subscription pack of 6 which lasts the 2 of us 2-3 months.
1965	5	Virgin coconut oil is great for your health and taste buds.<br /><br />I tried several different brands. I like this one a lot.<br /><br />I am not a big fan of coconut flavor, but this one smells different. It's preasant.<br /><br />Just 54-ounce jar was too big. I didn't have a sense of US unit. I recommend smaller jars if you don't bake often.<br /><br />You'll enjoy this oil as a substitution of butter and also you can use as your natural skin cream.
1966	4	I wish the mix had been inside a bag inside the box, that's my only complaint, as when I received the package some of the mix was leaking out due to rough mailing treatment.  Makes good pancakes.
1967	5	So very convenient for on the go or at home. My 6 month old can eat this up really quickly with no mess.  Boon makes spoon attachments for these but I have almost found you don't need them.  My girl can literally just suck it out.  Best baby food ever.  I love that it is organic.  Easy clean up....can't go wrong!!! Tastes really good, I will even eat one sometimes if we are out and about.
1968	5	I was really happy to see this organic paprika offered as an option in Amazon's Add-on program.  I use paprika in many ways: spice rubs, stew and goulash, sloppy joe mix, sauces, or any dish that needs a boost.  For example, it's great to sprinkle on french fries (after frying, as paprika can burn, or before I've baked them), along with salt and black pepper.<br /><br />This particular product is a "sweet" (not spicy or smoked) paprika, so keep that in mind when reading or creating a new recipe.  Also, since it comes in a glass bottle, I recommend keeping it in either a pantry or, as my grandmother advised, the refrigerator; sometimes light can affect the flavor of spices.<br /><br />Recommended!
1969	5	My 13-month old twins love this! I started giving them this snack when they were 9 months even when they only have few teeth since it easily melts and I never had to worry about choking at all. I subscribed and have this delivered every 2 months.
1970	5	I Love Honey Tree's Agave Nectar. I know how much healthier it is than sugar or other sweeteners. I use it in my hot tea every morning, on my pancakes, in cooking and on my desserts. It's better for you since it is organic, and it's also on the glycemic index...which means your blood sugar level does spike and then drop-leaving you feeling tired. I would recommend this product to anyone and everyone.
1971	1	In my opinion, this is not good coffee- I've tried it plain and tried "doctoring" it, but cannot bring myself to drink a cup of it.
1972	5	I have this tea almost every morning year round. It is never bitter or harsh.It is not a heavy tea like English breakfast.The blend of Assam,Nilgiri and China Keemun is a perfect match. Very good with a little milk and sweetener.My personal favorite!
1973	5	This brown rice pasta has great consistency. It is not mushy our crumbly. It does not get dried out if you leave it in the fridge. I actually cook and freeze large quantities in pre portioned amounts so I can just grab and go.this brand rates just like regular pasta.
1974	5	Good stuff! I just ate it on apple slices and the bittnerness from the walnuts balanced with the sweetness from the apples.  Very creamy and light in texture, but filling.  I like supporting local organic farms and even though I live in AK, I'm CA at heart and we don't have many nut farms here :)
1975	5	I have very limited counter space so this storage drawer holder is the perfect solution! My Keurig sits on top and the drawer easily slides in and out.
1976	5	Gore Range Blend from Vail Mountain Coffee and Tea is one of my favorite coffees.  Amazon has it at a reasonable price for a gourmet cup of coffee.  I highly recommend this blend.
1977	2	Having tried just about every other vegan jerky item on the market I was excited to find one that is completely gluten-based, offering a very reasonable protein-to-calories ratio (~10%), a reasonable price-per-ounce, plus great reviews to boot.  Got the product and discovered to my great chagrin that it requires refrigeration after opening!!  Not only does that fly in the face of what jerky is supposed to be, it is not disclosed anywhere in the Amazon product description.  Ouch!  So much for taking these 4oz packages on the trail, or anywhere else for that matter.<br /><br />Also, be aware that the product -- unlike several competitive vegan jerky products -- is made in Taiwan which could mean it uses Chinese gluten.  That's a source I personally try to avoid because of significant food safety issues in the past.  However, I contacted the manufacturer and was told that their gluten is "imported from either Australia, Western Europe or the USA......most all our ingredients are from these sources.  We manufacture in Taiwan because they have ways of cooking with soy and wheat gluten that are not found in the west."<br /><br />All that said, taste is pretty good and the "wet" packaging gives it a softer texture than competitive products (which I personally still prefer).
1978	5	These Hershey's got me through some pretty hard times. I think i ate about 2 bags all by myself. They tasted amazing and were less expensive that purchasing at the store. I love my amazon prime membership!
1979	5	This is amazing stuff especially with Amazon Prime. PB2 + APO + Amazon Prime = almost like home. It taste better than real peanut butter and there are endless recipes to try!<br /><br />I use this in my shaker cup with Chocolate Shakeology, 3 tbsp of PB2 and 12oz of 1% milk. Get's me at least one healthy meal per day!
1980	5	Really good, kind of strong, but not bitter. Has more of a mouthfeel than other teas - might make it a good substitute for coffee.
1981	4	"Delivery was fast. I ordered this for my mother who is on a very low sodium diet. Thanks to people like you who make these kinds of items available! Great product!"
1982	5	We're a upcoming Authentic Mexican Style Salsa Company formerly from Tucson, Arizona, now located in Bend, Oregon. We wanted to make gift baskets for our customers and needed products to fill them. The Garden of Eatin' Blue Tortilla Chips fit the theme and hit the mark. We will continue with this product for any additional Gift Baskets we'll need as our business grows. SouthwestSalsaCo.com
1983	5	The only product from Sempio I've tried is the bulgogi sauce. The marinade is great when you are low on time and&#65279; want to whip up something quick. The sauce is also really flavorful. At first it smelled salty, but when cooked, you get a good balance of salty and sweetness to it. I also love that it has real marinade ingredients such as garlic (which you can see) in it so it has a more of a homemade sauce feel instead of a marinade that is full of preservatives. I also love that it has no MSG.
1984	4	I'm all about dental treats for my dog and i prefer these to greenies because i find the ingredients a liitle better but @ over 40 cents a treat that lasts 1 minute, i'll probably buy them maybe only a couple times a year. His other dental treats by Virbec, the CET chews and the hextra chew dental treats @ $9 for 30 treats is 30 cents per stick and that's usually my limit (teenie greenies are $0.22-25 each). Definitely a nice texture, not unhealthy and my dog very much likes them.<br /><br />Get Naked Treats:<br />Organic brown rice powder, rice powder, tapioca starch, gelatin, natural chicken flavor, oat fiber, carrageenan gum (natural seaweed extract), chia seed, parsley +(vitamins/minerals)<br /><br />Greenies:<br />Gelatin, wheat protein isolate, glycerin, soy protein isolate, sodium caseinate, natural poultry flavor, hydrogenated starch hydrolysate, lecithin, vegetable oil (preserved with mixed tocopherols) +(vitamins/minerals)
1985	1	BEWARE- The items advertised are not what they ship. The item pictured is indeed Colavita Italian Extra Virgin Olive Oil. The item is described as " Italian Extra Virgin Olive Oil... it is the natural juice squeezed from Italian olives ... COLAVITA guarantees its product to be 100% Italian olive oil and properly labeled. A true Italian."<br /><br />However, the item shipped is NOT Italian. It is a blend of Mediterranean olives and is inferior to what they claim they are selling. If you're not looking specifically for higher quality oil, then this is for you, but don't buy it at this price.
1986	5	This is a very good cat food; high quality and eagerly gobbled up by 8 picky cats at our house.  Be aware that it is $10 cheaper for the same sized bag at Walmart.  Jest sayin'.....
1987	4	It's really hard to find any bagel chips in stores around here. They arrived in good shape. Had a 3+ month best used by date. So much better then chips or crackers! I'm a happy camper.
1988	5	This flavor is my favorite I have tried so far - nice and spicy without being overpowering. Great price for buying these in bulk. The small bags are good to have on hand for passing out to your friends or co-workers too!
1989	1	Had I known there was aspartame in this I would never had ordered.  Amazon need to make ingredients readily available.
1990	1	Cats are carnivores.<br /><br />Science Diet has no meat.<br /><br />Instead, you get cheap corn filler, spent rice leftover from brewing beer, and meatless chicken parts that humans don't eat, like beaks.
1991	5	Mi-Del Swedish style ginger snaps are delicious and nutritious!  They are made with organic flour and ginger, and are great with any meal- especially with coffee or tea.  It is not easy to find these treats in a market- and ordering from Amazon is quick, easy, and cost effective.  They arrived promptly, without one broken ginger snap. Thanks, Amazon!
1992	5	I love the rich, bold flavor of this coffee.  It has chocolaty undertones that are just brilliant.  Highly recommend it if you like dark roasts.
1993	5	This is an easy review:  put it in the dog dish and see what happens.  Our thin, finnicky eater would let us know.  Verdict:  once a day eater and only when hunger gobbled this down.  Now to the ultimate test:  mix with her regular dog food.  Results:  separates her old food and gobbles Chef Michael's.  Verdict:  my dog absolutely loves this.  Problem:  how can I ever go to another brand.
1994	5	I originally bought this for the African Nector, which is super yummy.  I was pleasantly surprised to find all the other 4 flavors they have in this package are all exceptional quality.  I normally don't drink Chamomile as it is too bland for me.  But, their Chamomile Citrus?  Totally different story! All of the teas have very aromatic presence, and the flavors are to be savored and appreciated.  I am running out already...gotta buy another one!
1995	4	Alvita changed their lea licorice tea not the same - but my daughter likes it.  She normally uses tea in her tea but she said she does not use tea in licorice tea - it is sweet enough.
1996	5	I love coconut so I don't have a problem using it in my foods! My children like it too, and so does my husband! he says it gives the food an exquisite taste. I use it instead of butter to fry or saute onions, cook eggs, steamed vegetables, and even in my rice, plus a little bit goes a long way! we rally like it most of all because you get a lot of omega from it. Very healthy! One thing is the price... I found better price on other websites and even at local Vitamin stores.
1997	1	I HAVE TO SAY IN THE BEGINNING..I HAVE NOT TRIED THIS FOOD, IT HAD ME SOLD. I SAID OH BOY! ITS MADE BY PAUL NEWMAN IT "HAS" TO BE GOOD! THIS SHOULD "NOT BE CATARIZED "ORGANIC"!! ITS DECEITFUL. IT SHOULD BE ADVERTIZED AS PARTIALLY ORGANIC! THEN YOU WONT BE UPSET THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU WANT TO BE ORGANIC---THE MEAT---IS NOT! WHO CARES IF YOUR VEGGIES R ORGANIC? WELL YEH IT HELPS DEF BUT THEY DONT NORMALLY RAISE VEGGIES WITH ANTIBIOTICS ETC ETC!<br />SO IF ORGANIC IS WHAT UR LOOKING FOR WALK UP THE AISLE TO CASTOR AND POLLUX ORGANIX DOG FOOD! EVERY SINGLE INGREDIANT "IS"  O  R  G  A  N  I  C  !!!<br />SHAME ON YOU THE COMPANY OF ONE OF MY FAV ACTORS! IM TRULY SURPRISED HE LET THIS BE UNDER THE REVIEWS OF ORGANIC!
1998	5	This product is great for replenishing your muscles after a tough work out.  I have also used Cytomax during the course of playing pick up basketball and it really keeps me going.  Normally when I just drink water or Gatorade during a hard workout I would be sore the next day.  Now that I am using Cytomax I am no longer sore and it seems I can work out longer and harder.  I know this sounds like a commercial but this stuff really works and it taste pretty good.  Plus you can't be the price.
1999	3	I usually give my cats canned food as a treat, so I thought I would give this a try for them.<br /><br />Like the other reviews the ingredients list was nice, there were a few ingredients I wasn't sure about like carrageenan and menadione sodium bisulfite but they all turned out to be a mineral supplement or a thickening agent.<br /><br />I opened the chicken pot pie first. Very watery with pea sized chunks of chicken, tiny bits of carrots and what looks like onion in it. It smelled like cat food.<br /><br />The sesame chicken also smelled like cat food, mind you not like a horrible smell, but if you put that and the actual chicken pot pie or sesame chicken in front of me blindfolded I'd be able to tell which was which just from the smell, it's a cat food smell. Anyway, the sesame chicken had pea sized chicken bits in it along with carrots and rice and a hint of sesame oil aroma to it.<br /><br />Minion Number Two is my picky eater (no, that's a nickname). He liked the juice and ate a few bits of the meat then went to his regular cat food, even side by side he still didn't eat the treat.<br /><br />Minion Number One (also a nickname) will eat most natural foods from potatoes, hamburger to whole wheat bread. He too enjoyed the juice a lot, ate a few pieces of the chicken then wandered off. He never came back to finish it.<br /><br />It gets three stars. Two for the ingredients and one that my cats like the juice. It doesn't get five because one, the price, I can see why it's more (because of the ingredients) but my cats will finish off other cans of cat food that are only half the price which is point two, being two adult male cats with hearty appetites they didn't like it enough to finish it.
2000	5	After a little bit of research, I learned that magnesium plays a crucial role in the regulation of the heart. After being on medication for some time for unpleasant heart palpitations (which never worked too well), I decided to give this supplement a try. In about 2 months, the palpitations were completely gone, and I don't have to take that horrible drug anymore! This stuff is awesome. This was about a year ago. I have come to realize that doctors know nothing about caring for the human body and know very little about real nutrition. Your just a customer to them; they make their money by prescribing dangerous drugs that only mask symptoms but don't correct the problem at its source. Magnesium is so important for the body - you cannot go wrong with this supplement. Most people are deficient in this important mineral because the land is so devoid of important minerals these days, so it's very hard to get from food alone. This is the best magnesium supplement on the market. Don't take those cheap magnesium pills you can get at any store. Most of them don't get absorbed by the body and act only as a laxative. Magnesium citrate, of which this product is, gets assimilated easily. Don't be surprised if other problems your having begin to clear up as well. Magnesium deficiency can cause a lot of problems. Read the book "The Magnesium Miracle" for more info.<br /><br />Peace.
2001	4	I have had a "twitching eyelid" problem for over a month now.  I've had that happen a few times here and there in the past, but never like this.  This was really getting bothersome, it was doing it like every 30 minutes or so for a few seconds at a time.  From the time I woke up till the time I went to bed.  It go so bad last week, I looked up again online about it...and somehow came across a forum where someone had the same problem and someone replied "you have a magnesium deficiency".  Well then I started looking up magnesium deficency and came upon this product.  I went and bought it the next day a local store.  And guess what??  My eye twitching has almost completely come to a STOP!!!  From something that was getting to be every 20-30 min. to now it does it about 2-3 times a day, much less noticable too, the twitching isn't as severe or bothersome.<br /><br />So I would have given this 5 stars, but I am still waiting to see if this supplement helps with any of the other problems, I've noticed after reading about magnesium deficiencies.  Those would be an added bonus if it helped with my other symptoms.  I am starting out with a small amount and will work my way up, and see if it gets any better with other things.  But I think it's great for just helping with my eye, it was literally driving me crazy!!<br />So glad I came upon this product...and the taste is really not bad at all.  I mix it with a whole glass of cold water, and it really only tastes like water with a lemon wedge in it, to me anyway...Maybe a larger amount of it, in less water might be too sweet, but it's really diluted in a full glass of water, so it isn't bad at all.
2002	5	My husband is the ultimate food snob and I would find him crunching on these biscotti all the time.  Also my daughter would pack these in her lunch, they are not too hard, so you don't have to dip them into coffee, they are perfect.
2003	3	I have no idea why I ordered these... must have been pretty hungry that day and just needed something to fill the order to get my free shipping.<br /><br />But speaking of shipping, I ordered these "MINI WHITE ROUNDS" and an equivalent order of "TATO SKINS".  The "skins" arrived unbroken while the "rounds" were about half rounds and half crumbles.  I think the difference was that the "skins" people engineered the size of the box just right so the puffy bags held each other in place, while the "rounds" people just threw a dozen bags into the box and only filled it about 3/4 of the way, leaving the bags free to slop around inside.<br /><br />Secondly, just the cursory test, I opened a bag and tasted a few, sort of expecting a "tostitos" or "mission" kind of taste, but they were just a kind of bland corn tortilla taste... which is exactly what they were supposed to be, but ... well you know... expected a taste that would keep me reaching back into the bag until I was ashamed of myself... the "Tato Skins" certainly did!  Maybe they'll be better when I dip them in some quacamole or something.
2004	5	A very fast delivery and a very high quality product. This is one of the best epazote I ever tried. Gives to my food that delicious taste. I'll be their permanent customer.
2005	4	My big Tuxedo cat loves these no end.  She will do tricks to get them and if offered she will eat them in large quantity.  My white cat MAY eat a couple if I don't ask to much attention in the process, otherwise he doesn't bother.  I don't know what the difference is but I like them because they don't stink and are easy to regulate piece by piece.
2006	2	I absolutely love my Sodastream because I drink a lot of sparkling water and this has saved me a fortune! Recently I thought it would be great to have some of the soda flavorings around for guests, mixed drinks, etc. However, I have not been thrilled with diet flavors I have tried so far. Of the three I have tried (diet tonic, diet ginger ale, and diet root beer), I think the diet root beer is the best, but is not even close to any of the name brand diet root beers.  Both the diet ginger ale and diet tonic have a nasty aftertaste - way worse than any name brand diet soda on the market.  The worst part about the aftertaste is that it doesn't seem to go away. As I write this, I still have a bad taste in my mouth - and it's been nearly a half hour since I drank some of the diet ginger ale. That alone compelled me to pull out my computer and log a review. I have tried them several times now, altering the amount of syrup to see if it would make a difference, and each time I end up pouring it down the drain. I am SO disappointed by this as I had high hopes for flavorings.
2007	1	I have given my dogs these dental treats before and they are very popular with them. The package I found on Amazon was a good price for the large quantity ordered. Since now I have paid the money and never received the item, and basically have found no direct route of getting refunded, I am not happy. I will be reluctant to purchase from Amazon again because there was no way for me to get hold of them for a reimbursement. I contacted UPS and they said Amazon likes to handle these things directly. And from looking all through Amazon's website, it says to contact UPS directly. And when I try to put in for a refund, the product not arriving is never an option---and there is no phone number or way to email otherwise. I guess I am out $30 for this purchase. I am disappointed in both Amazon and UPS for their service. I think if the product arrived, I would have likely been happy with it.
2008	5	Just like kids, my dogs hate taking pills when they are sick.  Thanks to Greenies for creating this product, I can easily hide their pills and they are willing to take it with no fuss or force.  It smells like their treats.
2009	5	I use this for making lavender bread which turns out amazing every time. (I also use it on chicken, making my own Herbes de Provence blend). It's just a nice consistent flavorful lavender, from box to box. I like that it's organic but especially that  Spicely owns all of its own facilities, so there's no chance of cross-contamination (with nuts, soy, or gluten, for example).<br /><br />The boxes are pretty small, so I go through a lot of them. (A larger 8-16 ounce container would be MUCH APPRECIATED to reduce the wasteful packaging) But excellent quality is never cheap. I'm glad to pay extra for a very good product. I used to live near near lavender fields where this sort of product was easily purchased in small family-owned shops. It's harder to find in stores or over the internet. So I'm thrilled to have discovered Spicely.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
2010	3	Bought this before trying others. I like another better. Don't get me wrong, this syrup is fine; I just like another better.
2011	3	Pomegranate is an unusual taste but one that you usually find combined with something else.  However here I found myself wishing it was a different licorice flavor.  It's sweet and tangy...but just one of those tastes that neither wows me or turns me off.  Just an average candy flavor in my book...<br /><br />Reading the package states it is made in mexico which when it comes to food I rather not see...especially on organic labeled items that should have a higher health standard.  Organic here of course just refers to the sugar used.<br /><br />All depends what you're looking for but it isn't something I'd choose again because of where it is made.
2012	5	These truffles are so cheep and taste delicious.  Better than some Godiva pieces.  The insides are not overly rich and have the perfect creamy texture that melts away in the mouth.  You can find these in Trader Joe Stores as well.
2013	4	Zevia Cola, a non-caloric soda sweetened with stevia, is a healthy alternative to sugared sodas and diet sodas that use artificial sweeteners.  If, like me, you believe diet sodas are unhealthy, but you don't like sucking down all that sugar (especially high fructose corn syrup) try Zevia.  The flavor isn't as strong as a Coke, which is why it only gets four stars, but it tastes good. For those like me who like a stronger cola flavor, I like to mix a little bit of Coca Cola with it, say 1/4 can, or a bit of cola syrup, to give it a richer cola taste, without adding a lot of calories.  I haven't tried the other flavors yet, but I'm satisfied that Zevia is a good value, especially if you take a subscription.  Also, you can order extra, or delay delivery without losing the subscription price.  It's a little over a dollar a can at the subscription rate (shipping is free), which is well worth the price if you drink it for the same reasons I do.
2014	5	I love the feeling that this shampoo leaves in your hair. Clean, fresh, shiny. It works great as an anti-dandruff shampoo. As well if not better then leading dandruff shampoos. It is clearly head and shoulders above the competition.
2015	1	Delicious cereal but the intense intestinal gas and cramping I will not be buying this one anymore. I am actually in a slight amount of pain. I tried a second box to make sure its not just me, but if you google kashi golean and gas, there are millions of hits.<br /><br />Also, the protein comes from Soy, a no no for certain types of Thyroid conditions.
2016	4	i am a converted veggo and used to LOVE steak. (stopped eating meat because of the treatment of our animals and the fact that any meat that is NOT organic is basically a toss between fatal and toxic)<br />doesnt taste like beef whatsoever. something good to compare it to or to say that its similar to would be chicken ramen noodle seasoning. Almost exactly the same taste.... not quite as potent since it has a much lower sodium content. If i were this product's company, I'd rename it chicken base. also, it's yellow..? the same exact color as ramen noodle seasoning-chicken. at east make it brown if you're going to claim it tastes like beef.<br />it is tasty but the advertising is a bit misleading.
2017	4	The taste and texture of the twists<br />are very good. I enjoyed this candy<br />but it seemed like a pretty small<br />amount for a package compared<br />to Licorice I usually buy at the store.
2018	5	I didn't think that Artisana could improve on their coconut butter (as it is just a pure delicious treat in a jar).  However with the addition of cacao to the butter I think they definitely took it up a notch.  I love to use this on a slice of toast in the morning and it provides such a wealth of nutrients as well as being very filling.<br /><br />I am sure there are more applications for it, but right now I can't move past it slightly melting on a slice of warm toast !
2019	5	Some people don't like these, but I found them to be very good. If you don't smell them before rinsing and blanching, you would never know they had an odd scent. One review said they were fishy smelling, but I thought it was closer to ammonia than fish. Either way, the smell disappears when they are prepared exactly as the package instructs. If you are looking for a wheat or grain pasta-type substitute, this is not it. But, if you like cellophane noodles and similar Japanese 'pastas' then this is your zero calorie version. They don't have any of their own flavor, so you will have to mix them with something obviously.
2020	5	Probably to bold for the average coffee drinker, but great for that first cup in the morning or when you first get to work in a high stress environment. Love IT! Best 1 cup coffee ive ever drank
2021	5	My dog loves these things and I found a good price on them here.  Good value and fast shipping.  Will buy again.
2022	5	I was super disappointed when Orbit discontinued my favorite flavor of gum.  There aren't many flavors that I like and when they came out with "Sangria Fresca" I was thrilled.  It appeared for a while that it was all gone, but Amazon, true to its word, let me know that some of this gum still existed.  I ordered two cartons and will order again based on continued availability.  Thanks Amazon!
2023	5	We often pick up boneless pork when it's on sale because it's versatile.<br />Having this coating on hand allows me to toss together a quick dinner that we always enjoy.<br /><br />I often add a little ground sage and black pepper to the coating.  Sometimes a little parmesan cheese.<br />If you're only preparing a small amount and have plenty of leftover coating for another small meal, a trick my brother shared with me is to use a good sized ziplock bag for the coating.  The leftover coating can be labeled "Pork" and dated and tossed into the freezer instead of throwing it out.  Same with chicken coating.  I often mix up my own coating and have plenty leftover for another meal.
2024	5	This is the BEST tasting Lingonberry jam.....just like I remember when I was a young child in Latvia.  Have difficulty finding it since our World Market closed in Omaha. Picked up a half dozen when I was in Kansas City.......
2025	5	My wife and I both enjoy a stronger flavored coffee.  I require decaf and this is the best tasting decaf we have tried.  Seems to be unavailable at most of the stores in our area that carry K-cups.  Order it from Amazon and you are good to go.
2026	4	The pumpkin flavor is suttle and not too sweet.  I rarely like flavored coffee but this one is well balanced and still tastes like "coffee".
2027	1	If I had a dime for every Buddhist who tried to poison me with MSG, I'd be a gazillionaire three hundred times over. Shame on the Chinese and shame on Japan. What wretched people they are.
2028	5	This is the best ! I add chicken mushrooms ,bok choy , green beans stir fry peas it is easy but you make it home made ! It is hard to get in Alaska so im always on the hunt:)
2029	5	This product is deicious and a great alternative for coffee lovers trying to break away
2030	5	Absolutely LOVE these!  They are a realistic substitue to real fries which I absolutely love.  These really help me stay on track while still being satisfied.
2031	4	Brought pantry moths home in a bag of cat food.  The trap seemed to catch many of them, and eventually, after a few rounds of purchasing traps, I stopped seeing evidence of moths in my kitchen.<br /><br />A word of caution: If you live in an apartment or have neighbors who live very close, make sure that the moths are coming from your home and not in the windows.  After my own infestation was cleared up, I noticed that moths were coming in through the windows to get to the lures.  As soon as your home is moth-free, get rid of the traps or you might end up with a new problem!
2032	5	Yum! These are a combination of all the things I like in a cookie. Texture like shortbread but a more interesting taste. (To the reviewer who complained that they are crumbly and break up in your mouth--that's what shortbread is supposed to do!) The honey is subtle, not too sweet, and the whole grains add some substance. The bits of fig and raisin are small--about the size of caraway seeds--and chewy. I was able to recognize the figs, but then, I like Fig Newtons, so I probably knew the flavor from that. Package says serving size is 3 cookies, but I found just 1 or 2 make a satisfying snack to nibble on without being too many calories or too much sodium. I'll probably buy these again.
2033	5	At first I was skeptical. When a friend informed me that there were different grades of vanilla beans and that Madagascar grade A-1 vanilla beans were the best, I thought is it really that different?  Vanilla is vanilla right?  Well, I couldn't have been more wrong.  These Bourbon vanilla beans are flavorful, fresh, and vital.  I "tested" them in a tapioca vanilla pudding recipe for which I had previously used vanilla extract and the difference was night and day.  I am now pulling out recipes for vanilla honey, vanilla maple syrup, vanilla coffee drinks, vanilla bean cheesecake, and more.  I was amazed at the uses of these beans also.  This product is highly recommended.
2034	3	This is the most USEFUL info you will ever need to know about K-Cups, and one that took me forever to discover:<br /><br />Bold/Extra Bold coffee in terms of k-cups does not mean that the coffee itself is stronger, it only means that they included more grind in the cups to provide you with a stronger coffee.<br /><br />There! Now you know.<br /><br />My mom goes for the Extra Bolds only because she has been addicted to caffeine for over 40 years now, and she's frugal and thinks this gives her more back for her buck (or rather mine, since I buy it for her).<br /><br />Unfortunately, out of all the Extra Bold k-cups she's tried, she claims that the Wolfgang Puck is the weakest tasting. She's tried it in both the medium & small serving sizes format, and both have produced less-than-full-flavor drinks.<br /><br />If you are looking for a rich, flavorful, strong-tasting coffee, try the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HKZZ7A">Van Houtte Cafe Honduras Medium Roast, Extra Bold Coffee, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a>.
2035	3	Although I love coconut oil and know of all the benficial ways to use it, this coconut oil tastes too coconutty for me.  I have to agree with other reviewers in that the smell is so strong it almost seems like an artificial scent. I dont mind coconut flavor and scents but this is almost too much.  It almost makes me gag.  I'll be going with Nutiva next time.
2036	5	I really like bold full flavored coffee without bitterness or too much acidity.  I wouldn't call myself a coffee aficionado but I do know what I like.  I own two French presses, an Aeropress, several drip machines, and a moka pot.  All are great but I love the ease of using my Keurig. After purchasing it last year I have probably tried 20 or 25 different k-cups.  For a while I really liked the Donut Shop by Coffee People.  But I grew tired of it.  It's great when it's hot but not so much when it cools off a bit.  Some of the other full bodied cups tend to be very bitter.  The Black Tiger, Jet Fuel, Wake Up Call, Newman's Extra Bold, etc. all can be good but not great.  I had pretty much decided that given the convenience of the Keurig machine I would have to sacrifice a bit on taste.  Then I stumbled on Diedrich's Sumatra and I'm hooked.  This is the one you want to buy in bulk and keep in the pantry.  It's a very good Sumatra blend that is great hot or even just slightly warm.  It's never bitter and very smooth.  It has that classic chocolate Sumatra flavor.  For me this is the only k-cup I've found to be consistent time after time.  I'm on my fourth box already.
2037	1	This is the first time I buy something without checking the reviews, and I can't believe the quality of this product, it's impossible to drink, I've tried two and this is disgusting, I'm not sure if there's something wrong or this is the real taste, but it will go direct to the garbage because this order cannot be returned. Don't order this Vita coco Tropical.
2038	1	I was looking for alternative healthy protein snack with less fat than slim  jims. Texas BBQ sounded like an awesome flavor---so I bought them. For those of you who have never tried them....pick up a rubber band, baste it in bbq sauce and then eat. That is what this soy protein jerky taste like...a bbq flavored rubber band. The only way I will ever eat these again is if the world no longer has any other protein choice available.
2039	5	I have been using my human Rescue Remedy to calm my pets when traveling and most importantly when going to the vet for a check up. I get nervous going to the doctor(hence Rescue Remedy for me) so I can only imagine what an animal goes through. It worked but I knew they didn't enjoy the alcohol taste(I had to hold them down and quickly squirt before letting go. I tasted the pet formula before trying to give it to my cat. I approved and the cat licked it up in no time so I guess she approves it also. A calm cat is a joy for me and for the vet who has to handle the animal.
2040	5	Not only does he love it but we never have a problem with separation anxiety when he sees his kong ball with the stuffin inside!
2041	5	I have been addicted to the lemon pure fitness, no longer available here or at my local store.  I tried the new Pure, it's just as good with real sugar and a little artificial sweetener.  I give the product five (5) stars and the price from this seller as less than zero.  Until Amazon offers it at a decent price, I will have to buy it local, what a tough world sometimes huh.
2042	5	This is the best Crystal Light flavor around.  It seems that my area is not the only one where it has vanished off the grocery shelves. Why?  I take Statins which regular grapefruit juice intensifies. This product is the only thing around that replaces the real thing.  It has a very natural taste and really makes a great breakfast drink.  Thanks to Amazon, we can still get this product.  I hope they continue to make it.
2043	1	I've ordered this item three times.  Lightly salted, right?  Three times I've gotten my order, and three times it's been wrong.  Very disappointing.<br /><br />The chips themselves are very tasty, though...just WAY too salty for me.
2044	5	My GoldenDoodle likes this treat for training and also for use with the everlasting treat ball. To make these cost effective I split them in two and also mix them with his regular kibble (only 1/5 treats) when stuffing them in the treat ball. I bought these for treat variety, to save money on the refill disks, which my dog loves but are expensive, and also to save time cutting up the Van Patten [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000633V3O">Natural Balance Beef Formula Dog Food Roll, 4-Pound</a>food rolls. I am buying my second bag today.
2045	5	Quality product in minimal packaging to reduce waste. Thick cornflakes. Stay crispy longer. Probably have less salt than market brands, tastes like it. Have already re-ordered. These are our cornflakes from now on!
2046	5	Grinds brok da mouf!  Comfort food that puts your mind back to the sunny warm tropical islands of Hawaii (and a few pounds on to your body too).
2047	3	I have to say, I'm generally not a big fan of organic food. Especially since the taste of organic food can sometimes leave a lot to be desired.  Another drawback is that organic food is, in general, much more expensive than regular. But I have to say, these licorice sticks were a pleasant surprise. They weren't overly sweet and they have a very strong fruit taste. I enjoyed them a lot and would consider buying them in the store. However, I gave a piece to my mom and she said it was "terrible." She said it had a really nasty aftertaste. This isn't your run-of-the-mill licorice. However, I think this is one of those foods that either you love them or you hate them. Based on the other reviews I read of this product, there doesn't seem to be much in between. I would definitely be interested in sampling other flavors of this licorice.
2048	4	Bob Marley's son Rohan, besides being a noted athlete and musician, is also a successful entrepreneur, having started "Marley Coffee," the maker of "Marley Coffee, Stir It Up, Exotic Floral and Berry, One Love, Organic Medium Ethiopia Yirgacheffee," (fifteen single serve pods).<br /><br />Everyone in my family tried some of the coffee this morning and the results were generally very good; "smooth" x3, "nutty," x2, "nice taste," "I like mine a little stronger."  Pretty good comments from these life long coffee drinkers.  No one gushed that they were going to rush out and place another order, however.<br /><br />Bob Marley's name has been used to sell lots of things Bob probably wouldn't have endorsed while he was alive. To his credit, Rohan's signature actually appears on the outside of the box, so he is not technically appropriating his father's name.  He is asserting his own name and standing behind the product himself.<br /><br />Several of the drinker's this morning were hoping for a little THC mellow-out over their bacon and eggs.  Didn't happen.  However, everyone agreed that this coffee (which curiously doesn't smell that attractive before the pod is brewed) is worthy of the high-end packaging and its Ethiopian (and Jamacian) heritage.
2049	4	My wife gave me a package of Buffalo Bills "Premium Hickory Beef Jerky Pieces" for my birthday. So being the cool guy that I am, I took it on a recent 4-wheeling trip and shared it with my compadres. Here's what they had to say:<br /><br />"WATER!!!!!!!!!!"<br /><br />LOL! Seriously, this IS good jerky. But it's a tad bit salty, and has a VERY distinct soy flavor. Maybe because the first three ingredients are beef, water, and soy. haha! If you do not like soy, you will NOT like this jerky. But that aside, it was a good-sized bag, and we demolished it in pretty short order. The pieces were not too big or small, and it was not chewy. It was maybe a tad bit hard, but it was not sinewy. This was premium beef - no grissel! I highly recommend this and other Buffalo Bills jerky products.<br /><br />Just be sure you have something to drink (it goes great with beer)!
2050	5	This is my new favorite coffee.  I have tried over 20 different k-Cup brands and flavors and this one beats them all.  It comes out of the coffee machine looking like chocolate milk and has a very great French Vanilla flavor.  I would highly recommend this flavor.
2051	5	This is a great product. You can't beat it anywhere else. It's high quality and equal to the more expensive brands. I've tried Tropical Traditions, Nutiva and some other off name brands and although Nutiva is my absolute favorite, for the money the Vitacost brand is comparable in quality and taste. I'm very happy with this product and will continue to buy it as long as it remains cost effective.
2052	2	I've tried a few of these fruit and veggie squeeze packs (for my toddler primarily) in a few different brands.  This is the only flavor she didn't like.  She did try it, but gave it back to me after one bite.  Later, I tried to feed it to my baby with her oatmeal, and she didn't like it either!  I am a little surprised, since sweet potatoes are her favorite.  Maybe if your kids like apricot they will like this flavor, but mine didn't.  We'll be sticking with the Pears, Peas, & Broccoli flavor.
2053	5	Two years ago, this product was available at most large grocery chains, military commissaries and all pet stores.<br />Now it appears that it is only available thru on-line purchase.  Amazon's price was lower than I had ever paid - even before taxed. It is a great product and Amazon process and delivery service was prompt. I recommend both the IAMS dog gravy AND Amazon.com.
2054	5	We use these to make baby food and a "Sweet potato casserole" for Thanksgiving.  They were just fine.  We rinse them off before using them in the baby food to try to help a little with the extra sugar from the packing syrup.  Our sweet potato casserole calls for pureeing the yams.  I really haven't tried them any other way so, for our purposes, these yams are great and are the best deal I could find for shipping yams.
2055	5	Doesn't leave you with a heavy feeling like pretzels do.  If you are on a no sugar, no flour diet, these are perfect snacks.
2056	5	Absolutely the best.Great product and the packaging is very good also.I would recommended it to anyone and I will reorder soon
2057	5	The price for these are great considering what they go for at the grocery store.  Plus, they are organic which is best for baby.  If your baby likes these, then you can save money this way!
2058	5	I love using this thing, yes it makes small batches, but 1 batch makes 12-14 ice cubes which is 12-14 ounces of baby food. Typically when babies start eating they eat 1-2 ounces a day of baby food, so 1 tray lasts 1 week or more.<br /><br />You don't need to make huge batches when they are little and when they are big you just put when you are eating in there and dice it up!<br /><br />People have mentioned issues with cleaning, but I follow the rules for cleaning and make the food with boiled water or nursery water.....and I clean it with baking soda....no mold problems what so EVER
2059	5	This is equivalent to starbucks and a lot cheaper.  We are coffee drinkers and worth it to buy it in bulk.  Great taste.
2060	5	This tea seem to be made with high quality Darjeeling type of tea, with full leaves. I make this tea with 1 teaspoon in the evening and later use it 2nd time before I go to bed, as a decaf. Tastes great as sweetened black tea and not best for making Chai. Addition of Lavender flowers really enhanced the taste and relaxing effect one feels with this tea, even though their is caffeine in the tea.
2061	5	This was sent to me as an after surgery gift to help make food taste good to me again.<br />And it is wonderful!  Adds savor without a lot of calories to so many things.<br />I ate it on poached eggs.<br />I dressed simmered new crop white beans with it and olive oil.<br />I made a garbanzo/pumpkin spread with it and oil cured olives as seasoning.<br />And the jar is only half gone.<br /><br />I have to figure out where to get the sun dried peppers it's made with so I can keep my new addiction.<br />It is a little spendy but it goes a very long way.
2062	5	These dogs chews are the best for my three dogs!  I've noticed that it has cleared up the plaque in their teeth. The trick is to buy the chews that have the "Chlorhexidine." I highly recommend this product to any dog parent. However, one thing to keep in mind is that not all dogs' stomach may agree to the chews. My other dog that lives with parents can't eat these chews because it upsets his stomach.
2063	5	Had purchased this mustard in a specialty shop in Niagara-On-The-Lake in Canada.  Liked it so much I went online to purchase more.  Try it on a chicken sandwich w/roasted red peppers and melted provolone cheese!!!
2064	5	My grandson loves the variety this package offers when making his snow cones.  The variety is great.  So many wonderful flavors to try.  No need to store a bottle afterwards which is good also.  Thanks.
2065	5	New puppy loves this, only treat he will pay attention to while walking and training. One note, pieces are quite large so I cut them up into smaller pieces so their recommended daily amount goes further.<br /><br />All the dogs in the dog park can't resist my pocket when I have these treats. Usually surrounded by a crowd of dogs all poking at my pocket.
2066	5	These are genuine Greenies product, not a knockoff.  My dogs love them!  It is their favorite treat.  I have 2 small dogs, both under 10 lbs. and the Teenie size is perfect for them.  I paid $22.37 for this 96-pack and it is by far the best price I have found anywhere.  I wish these were part of the Subscribe & Save program.
2067	5	i use one of these tabs in my coffee and it's perfect--not too sweet or too bitter--also easier to use than the "pink" sweetener pack and no paper pack to throw away every morning.  also this small bottle is super easy to transport in my luggage when i travel.  have used the pink things for years--but this is sooooo much easier!!
2068	5	These Stewarts Liver treats are the love of my wirehaired dachshund's life.  Nothing else comes close.<br />I have bought them from several sources and sometimes they are crushed but those fom Amazon arrive in fine condition and ready for munching.
2069	5	I first received the scented bags as a "bonus" with my regular bags.  I loved them so much that I was bummed when I had to switch to the "regular" ones I actually bought.  The scent is very strong, but not to the point where it's offensive in its own right, but is strong enough to mask the unpleasant smells the bags contend with.  I didn't have the other reviewer's problem- the scent remained for as long as I had the bags, and even made my "regular" bags smell good to an extent.<br /><br />Even more importantly- this is the only brand of bags I use.  I've tried others, and I've had breakage or size problems.  These are perfect.  They've never broken, and they're the perfect length for easy, clean tying.  I love them.
2070	1	These are the "dry" version of the ones available in the refrigerated deli section of most large supermarkets.  Those are the ones I want to comment on.<br /><br />I will never forget the first time I encountered Li'l Smokies.  I was out shopping for beer with a friend.  We were passing the case with hot dogs, lunch meat, and other prepared cold cuts.  He picked up a package of Li'l Smokies, tiny chubs in heavy shrink-wrap.  He held them out to me, and solemnly intoned, "Sir, your horse is very sick."<br /><br />Leopold Bloom "purveyor of fine wines and cheeses"
2071	5	These little packets are great for toddlers on the go, especially ones who need some convincing in the way of veggies. A great way to get a little extra iron in their bellies.
2072	5	I buy these bags of cola-goodness about 3-4 times a year for my little brother -- these are the same product that he adores when he drives to Disneyland and makes a pit stop at Casa de Fruta. If you're wondering how big a 5-pound bag is, you'd be surprised at the size: since these are the "giant" cola bottles, imagine a grocery-store produce baggie, fully packed and heat-sealed, but "super heavy". This is a nicely textured gummi: not too soft and it has just the right touch of cola flavor.
2073	5	There is a whole lot of cinnamon in this cereal (i.e. a lot of cinnamon left in the milk dregs), and I love it! I think it tastes like gingerbread, but I could be wrong. There is no ginger, but it reminds me of some kind of Christmas cookie in America. I have not purchased this cereal from Amazon so I can't talk about Amazon's quality or packaging/shipping, but the cereal itself is very good. It's the regular Heart-to-Heart cereal, but with an upgrade of sorts.
2074	5	Tully's "House Blend" has become the coffee I always have on hand. It has a  rich, deep, full bodied flavor without being bitter. I have a delicate stomach so occasionally I do notice the slight acidic content, but typically have no issues with this blend.
2075	4	I am a frequent drinker of black tea, so I am able to compare this with the many other brands of tea I have purchased before.  It's an OK cup of tea, not bad, but nothing special either.  The ingredients are natural, just black tea and oil of bergamot, but it somehow lacks the flavor of a fine earl grey.  Though the name Higgins and Burke sounds English, it appears to come from distributors in Canada and Texas.  It doesn't say on the teabag where the tea comes from and when I visited the manufacturer's website, it wasn't clear there either.<br /><br />This does not compare with some of the better quality tea makers, such as Barney and Sons.  But for the price, it offers a decent value.
2076	5	Have used many boxes of this coffee in my Keurig.  It is full-bodied and very good, but not too strong/bitter.  Highly recommend.
2077	5	These delicious cookies were appreciated by my mother and her friends.<br />I intend to try the other flavours available.
2078	3	Warning - this tea is packaged in the US, and not the UK.  Hence, it is weak and tasteless compared to the British equivalent.  Very disappointing.
2079	1	People DONT BUY THIS GARBAGE from Costa Rica. This product is harmful to your health as it contains Hydrolyzed Corn Protein which is MSG. This CHEMICAL is bad for your health and has different effects on your body.<br /><br />The numb skulls down in Costa Rica just want to make DINERO off of you and do not care what the consumers scarf down their throats. Just like the cigarette companies...their bottom libe is PESOS. Don't believe me? Just google Hydrolyzed Corn Protein and see for yourself.<br /><br />Also, this sauce can be easily made in your home with wholesome ingredients and without the chemicals and MSG that is detrimental to your health and your families health.
2080	5	THIS IS FOR MY SUNTS FOR CHRISTMAS THEY LOVE THIS KIND OF TEA AND NOW THAT IT IS K-CUPS THEY ARE EVEN HAPPIER.
2081	5	Bought frozen crab cakes from a couple places. They were OK. Tried crab meat from Sam's & Wal-Mart. This product is superior to any thing else I've tried. Good price on a good product.<br />Here's my recipe:<br />Southern Style Crab Cakes w/ Roasted Pepper chive Aioli<br />Ingredients:<br />12 oz lump crab meat, drained (reserve liquid for later. May be used to make meat mix the right consistency or to extend mixture with extra bread crumbs if needed)<br />¼ cup celery, finely diced<br />½ cup chives, minced (¼ cup for meat mix- ¼ cup for chive aioli)<br />½ cup mayonnaise (¼ cup for meat mix- ¼ cup for chive aioli)<br />1 large egg<br />2 tsp Dijon mustard<br />¼ tsp hot sauce<br />App. ½ cup plain bread crumbs. Add bread crumbs or reserved liquid as needed to get correct consistency after refrigeration<br />¼ cups roasted red pepper, drained<br /><br />4-10-10. Changed recipe to panko bread crumbs. Big improvement. Adds great texture/crunch to crab cakes. Ordering another case of crab meat today.
2082	3	I put some in my morning joe, and I wasn't able to drink it.  The flavor was terrible.  I haven't baked with it yet so I dont't know if will taste better in baked goods or not.
2083	5	What can I write about ramen that hasn't been written before now?  It is decently flavored, packed full of sodium, and has a long-ish shelf life.  That is our purpose in purchase - we keep these as our emergency earthquake food.  Maybe not the best choice considering the amount of water it would take to prepare but it is affordable for us at this time.<br /><br />This flavor is not my favorite but the bf maintains that they are "edible" and that he would "eat them again."  Five stars because I don't know how to downgrade a vote for ramen.  It's as steady as the sun.
2084	5	My blood pressure had been in the prehypertensive (140s/90s) for several weeks.... my diet was pretty decent (5-6 frutis/veggies, good oil, etc.) and I walked 3-4 miles/day, so I was surprised.<br />Before going to a doctor for meds, decided to do some resesarch on natural blood pressure and magnesium came up as a suggestion. I settled on this on on a friend's advice. Take it 2x/day. My blood pressure has been 105-120/70s for the past month. Maybe it's a coincidence, but I'm happy.
2085	5	I love Amazing Grass products.  They definitely make me "feel" better.  If green had a taste this would be it.  I do mix them with other things to enhance the taste.  I enjoy the Chai but I think it is a little strong.  I switch it up every couple of days with other products so I don't get tired of it.
2086	1	Walden Farms dressings are very tasty.  When I ordered this, it said 12 12oz. bottles...and the weight is still listed at 10.4 lbs., package wt. still says 11 lbs.  Imagine my surprise when the $9.00+ was for only one bottle!!  I can purchase this same dressing locally for under $4.00.  Buyer beware!
2087	5	We've tried most the Kind bar flavors, but this one is THE favorite among my bunch.  They offer a perfect blend nutty and sweetness... Even people who don't care for nuts seem to love these bars.
2088	4	I've never had a cup of coffee that was so smooth tasting, kind of like when you buy the expensive liquor instead of the store brand. The coffee was a bit on the weak side but I felt the flavor of the Ethiopian yirgacheffe balanced that out somewhat.<br /><br />I bought some of these pods for my sons to use at college. They bring a sealed packet with them in their bookbags when they leave home for the day at school, and get free hot water from the drink vendors on campus for a nice pick me up between classes. They both love the coffee, and the convenience.<br /><br />I did take positive note of the ethically farmed notation on the box, and the fact that this product is certified organic. This company also supports Ital and Kicks for Cause. Nice.
2089	5	Outstanding cheese with some personality.  Grates well for pasta, potatoes, omelettes.  Wine - while fine with some Spanish (and other) reds, this cheese is especially tasty with a peary Sauv Blanc.
2090	5	These cookies are good, chewy and have great flavor.  Next time I may try baking a slightly shorter time than recommended, as mine were a little too brown around the edges but otherwise, perfect.  My son (who does not have celiac) thought that they were fantastic and was disappointed the day after I made them when I had finished them off!  I just couldn't stop after missing good, fresh from the over cookies for years.<br /><br />I noticed a few negative reviews here from people who have not tried the products!  Shockingly, there is even one from someone plugging her own gluten free bakery and then hypocritically criticizing others for getting on the "gluten free bandwagon" since there are "bucks to be made"! Well, it turns out that perhaps the larger manufacturer has the research money and testing facilities to get the taste RIGHT.  This mix (along with the yellow cake mix) is better than nearly all of the specialty mixes I have tried.  It is sad how many pans of cakes, brownies, blondies and cookies I have tossed in the garbage because they were inedible.<br /><br />Thank you Betty Crocker (General Mills) for making a very high-quality gluten free mix available in my regular grocery store!
2091	4	These aren't the tastiest protein bars (not that any of them are "tasty"), but they will give you a lot of protein and fiber. They're much cheaper at Walmart, though, where they're around $8 for a 6-pack.
2092	4	Just be aware that you need to add flavor to this with foods or flavored oils and you will like it a lot. Very easy to use.
2093	1	This meal is way over-herbed. Not just the garlic, but also the rosemary. I mean, they went crazy on the herb! Even for an adult it would be too much, let alone for a baby's delicate palate. I expected more balanced flavored from Tyler Florence. My baby didn't even want to touch it. It's too bad, because if the seasoning were more subtle, this would have been very tasty--the turkey and mashed vegetables were nice enough.
2094	3	It taste just like the Vanilla Latter, to be honest aside from the expresso all Dolce Gusto coffe tastes the same to me.
2095	4	I think you either love or hate drinks like this and personally, I loved this one. I felt it was nicely balanced in its flavor and was unique; I'd never tried a product like this before from a can! I was surprised and impressed by the taste. It's in a slim (cute) can and the only downside is that it is addictive; I totally wanted to have another can. (or two!)<br /><br />If coffee is part of your everyday life, I encourage you to give this a try and see if you like it. Personally, I did. Smooth and with a balanced flavor, it tasted great on a hot (nearly) summer day!
2096	5	Never a disappointment, always a laugh and since its in blu-ray its a joy too!!!
2097	2	I picked up a package of Via out of curiosity. For the record, I am the owner of a coffee roastery and a cafe which has won "Coffee Bar of the Year" for the past 4 years in CT. We roast coffee for other cafes as well so I feel I have a pretty good grasp of what a good coffee should taste like. Here's my impression of Via:<br /><br />It is certainly easy to prepare. I generally drink a 16oz coffee so I used 2 packets (they are sized for an 8oz serving) to prepare my cup. The coffee is ready to drink as soon as it is stirred.<br /><br />I drink my coffee black and what I taste is only the coffee (my preference for brewing water is a neutral pH of 7, a Langelier Index of zero and no chlorine, fluoride, or lime).<br /><br />On to the coffee:  A good Colombian should be very balanced, with good body, brightness* and a nutty flavor. Truth be told, most Colombian coffee on the market is a bit boring, and most are at best a simply decent, clean cup with almost no aftertaste. Unfortunately this is only true if it's fresh** from a roaster which is unlikely.<br />The Via Colombian that I tried might have started out as an Arabica coffee from the low end of the Specialty Coffee spectrum. Since I don't know the timeline for production, it is very difficult to say how old the coffee was to begin with but there is definitely a "woody" note that I associate with aged beans. The actual flavor might not be terrible if you where able to separate out this woody note but unfortunately Via has a very objectionable mouth feel and aftertaste. After a few seconds, there is a very noticeable residue left on your tongue that is bitter and astringent. I typically associate this with a brew that has had coffee grounds siting in it such as when a coffee filter collapses while brewing.<br /><br />Bottom line for me: I would drink it only if my only other choice was a widely available and well known "donut" shop coffee (which I am mystified why anyone would drink...just terrible). As for the flavored versions of Via, I am really not a fan of ANY flavored coffee since these flavorings are typically unhealthy and serve mostly to mask the objectionable tastes of the coffee. I drink coffee because I like the flavor. This was my second tasting of Via. I tried it when it was first released in 2009 and was hoping to see an improvement but my notes from that tasting are very similar. I really think that a high end instant is a good idea, but unfortunately for me, Via misses the mark.<br /><br />For a quick and relatively convenient cup, I would suggest investing $30 in an "AeroPress" made by Aerobie and widely available. Armed with a freshly roasted coffee from your local micro roaster, you get a tasty, easy to prepare cup, and a very simple cleanup..<br /><br />* We use the descriptive term "acidity" to describe brightness. This is not to be confused with the often heard term "acidic" which people lament about a coffee that upsets their stomachs. This is thought of by many people in the industry to be the result contamination of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, molds, fungus, and other contaminants often found in non-specialty grade coffee. We believe that most of these complaints would disappear simply by trying a better quality coffee.<br />** Fresh = less than two weeks from roasting. Most coffee is WAY beyond this timeline....
2098	5	I like that this one is 95% steviosides.  There are no fillers to contend with.  And, of course, it's nice and sweet.
2099	5	I absolutely love this cereal.  Smells soooo good!  Almost has a banana-y smell to it in my opinion.  I mix it into whatever food my son is eating just for some added health benefits. I also really like the packaging.  A canister is so much better than a non-sealable box like another organic brand (and non-organic brands) comes in.  I've tried the rice and multi-grain cereals too but prefer the consistency of the oatmeal better than the multi-grain (which is a good cereal too but was more flakey and "soft".  Will continue to buy this product for some time.
2100	1	I was glad to have found these, but after trying them, I was sorely disappointed. All the gummies were HARD! They were hardly chewable by me, an adult, so I don't know how kids can chew this. I was disappointed that I had to give these away. They were lacking in flavor too. Only the red angry bird gummies were half soft, the rest were all hard. I don't recommend them, at least not from Amazon. Try somewhere else before you buy so you can give a quick squeeze to see if they are soft. I would have returned these if I had ample time to get replacements, but I didn't.
2101	5	Excellent price on these seeds. I no longer will let my indoor cats go without grass. Easy to germinate and very strong growth. Best of all, I will never again get ripped off buying seeds in those containers for cats (usually out of stock).
2102	1	When I first bit into the cookie, I felt it was "soggy". While the cookies were supposed to be gooey, they come across as soggy and stale. For a cookie named "Megafudge" these cookies did not have a strong chocolate flavor. The cookies tasted more fruity than chocolaty. They almost reminded me of the center part of a fig newton.<br /><br />I am surprised that a product this awful could make it to market. They are perhaps the worst store bought cookies I have tried to date.
2103	5	I've tried every bold k-cup and this is one is one of my favorites.  Very nice flavor and strength.
2104	5	These are great tasting snacks.  We love the chocolate and the cheesecake flavors.  Much easier to buy on Amazon.
2105	5	This trail mix is very tasty and easy to take with in the 6 oz. bags.  The only problem I have with it is not the product but the "zip lock" bags it comes in.  They DO NOT zip.  I have resorted to wrapping the opened bag with a strong rubber band to maintain freshness.
2106	3	It was ok. I tried a Thai ice tea that was great and spicey. I could actually taste the different spices and flavours but unfortunelty I didn't get it from this tea. It's good but not what I was looking for.
2107	5	This is a really nice product.  It is totally organic and unrefined, just what I wanted.
2108	1	Sure, this bread is good if you like having your ham & cheese between two slices of pound cake. I was not happy with this product at all. It was very cake like, but besides that the taste was awful. I will be making croutons out of it, hopefully I can mask the taste with loads of garlic.
2109	4	I had a 4 pound starving, adult feral cat arrive in my house a year ago. Her fur was falling out, her bones showed and she was diagnosed with FLUTD. After feeding her this food for the last year she is free of FLUTD, has the softest fur I have ever felt on an animal, save a chinchilla, and has maintained her weight at a healthy 9 pounds in spite of being an indoor cat.<br /><br />This food is well balanced, made from excellent ingredients and puts to use the latest in nutritional information about cats.<br /><br />Highly recommended<br /><br />Regarding frugalone "PJ"'s review: "No one knows for sure why some cats get FLUTD and others don't. Many potential causes have been hypothesized, including viruses, abnormal urinary retention, obesity, bladder defects, and-the most popular theory to date is improper diet. In reality, one or all of these factors might play a role in the occurrence of FLUTD."<br />--maxshouse.com<br /><br />(I have no affiliation with maxshouse.com)
2110	5	I'm based out of Indianapolis, so I got really excited to see a local roasterie here on Amazon!  Their Kenyan is one of my favorite flavors since you get a big bold flavor, some of the spicier notes typical of the African coffees, and a very smooth finish.<br /><br />Unlike some of the other coffees, though, this particular one does not stay as amazing as it cools, so I tend to avoid using it for cold drinks.
2111	3	This is a good buy but did notice it didn't taste as good as the smaller count box decaf. These tasted like they were overly roasted. I will not buy the 50 ct anymore.
2112	5	These are about $1.50 to $2.50 in the store, so I was pleased to find them on subscribe and save for $1.50 each or cheaper.  Good quality, sturdy enough to toss in a purse or backpack, and pleasantly sweet without being overwhelming.  Good substitute for candy when I want a treat.  Filling enough to hold me several hours when I'm on the go.
2113	4	I found this olive oil to be very good, but I take exception to the description of 'Unfiltered'. If it is, it is the clearest unfiltered oil I've ever seen. I wanted unfiltered and this clearly isn't what I was looking for. But, in fairness, it is still a very good product overall.
2114	5	I was a limited tea drinker until our purchase of our Keurig Coffee Brewer and the Green Mountain Sweet Peach Black Tea. I now have one com a day of the peach or of the sweet lemon.
2115	4	To be fair, this was my first attempt at home brewing.  With that in mind:<br /><br />I thought this was a well thought out kit, and the instructions were easy to follow.  Even though I did make a few mistakes in the process, the beer turned out better than I expected.  For a starter kit, I give it high marks.  There are a couple of things that, had I known, I would have accounted for and possibly had a better result:<br /><br />1)  The hops are in pellet form, and they fall apart when they hit the wort.  I strongly recommend that you use a natural cloth steeping bag to make clean up easier.  If not, expect to be picking flakes of hops out of your buckets, brushes, strainers, and teeth for a couple of weeks.<br /><br />2)  The instructions say to take the label off the can of malt extract.  What they forget to mention is that the label is pasted on with an industrial strength adhesive, from end to end, top to bottom.  Getting the label off requires a fair amount of patience and a lot of hot water.  It would be much better if the manufacturer would simply glue the label to itself so you can rip it right off without having to scald yourself on a hot can.<br /><br />Overall, the beer, while a touch stout for my taste, has been tasty.  The kit was well put together, especially from a beginning brewer's perspective.  I will likely purchase a red ale kit from the same maker for my next batch.
2116	5	The maple brown sugar flavor is getting hard to find in grocery stores around here.  What a great convenience to get supply sent to my door!  I wish I could buy all my groceries this way.  The bars were in good shape with no shipping damage.
2117	5	I started buying these large bags to use as Halloween candy.  I found that both children and adults like them.  The are bubblegum covered with a cherry flavored hard candy.  The balls are individually wrapped.  They also make good candy jar candy.  The large bags usually leave me with a little excess that I give to a friend who has a retail store.
2118	5	I had tried this tea when I bought it in a grocery store and like all revolution teas, it was not cheap!! Buying it on amazon let me buy more of it at less cost.<br /><br />I love this tea - it's very subtle - delicate earl grey flavors with a hint (HINT) of lavender. the other lavender earl grey's i've tried have been much too heavy on the lavender side. This one has a nice blend of both. It needs just a hint of sweetener or sugar/honey and it's perfect. It's good with milk or without. It is a black tea so has caffeine, but it's still relaxing - perfect for a stressful day at work where you don't want to be tired but want something mentally soothing.
2119	5	This is my second order.  The first order was just to sample the Dandy Blend to see it we liked it.  It was great.  My husband likes it better than Pero (coffee substitute).  Very satisfied with the product and how quickly it was shipped and received.  We will continue to order this item from this vendor.
2120	2	I usually don't review food products I purchase on here, but this stuff prompted me to do so. The texture of these is really disgusting. I tried making several boxes both in a pot and microwave and both ways made me literally gag. The noodles are cheap rice noodles, and the taste is something akin to salty peanut brittle. I have since tried a similar product by Annie Chun, which you can also purchase on Amazon and was far happier with the fresh noodles and ingredients in that product.
2121	4	they were good, the boxes were smaller than i thought and the flavors were a nice mix. all in all a good buy.
2122	3	I'm a big fan of Annie's Shells and White Cheddar (the purple box), so I figured I'd try this to see if it was as good. It's ok, but the whole grain pasta is very whole-grainy. It doesn't quite cook the same, the texture difference is very noticeable and the sauce doesn't seem to blend with it as well.
2123	5	This is my pre-workout, afternoon pick me up every day drink, love it!  Dont' know about burning any actual calories but it's a great energy drink with no jitters.
2124	5	I love this Baking Mix, in-fact, our our family loves it. Thanks Pamela's.<br />Don Mueller, Ogden,UT
2125	5	this wasabi was hot and fresh.  i like there that are no colorings or preservatives.  i also like the small can.  unused portion stays fresher and can is very useful after the product is gone.
2126	5	This is a great addition to the L.I.D. line.  My allergic dog eats the Venison formula and I got him this for some variety in his diet.  Rabbit is also a great, lean protein for him as he tends to gain weight.  I wanted to write this Natural Balance review because their products have helped my little guy so very much.
2127	2	ordered this - upon delivery it was melted in/all over the box, even outside of the plastic bag it was sealed into.<br /> (unsure of how a sealed product could have leaked out of its container when it was sealed under the lid)<br /><br />felt like it wasn't sealed well enough to have been safe or healthy to use.<br />no expiration date either.
2128	5	This is the best Sesame Oil I have ever used. Has a very rich and full flavor. Highly recommend this product. Excellent service, shipping fast and product well packaged. Will definitely order again.
2129	4	My son has developed a love for Lucky Charms cereal. Unfortunately that love often only includes the tasty marshmallows and the actual cereal part ends up being dropped on the floor for our "automatic vacuum" (the dog) to clean up. These seemed like a good way to ensure that our Lucky Charms cereal stays as it should. First of all, these do indeed taste very much like the marshmallows found in the cereal. They are crisp, solid-colored, and fresh tasting. Made in the US, the packages had only about a year before its "sell by" date so keep in mind to only order as much as you can use in a reasonable time. Finally, these are small 5 1/4 x 7 1/2 bags so most should be able to use them while fresh. All in all these are a great purchase for marshmallow lovers.
2130	5	I am relatively new to the world of pod coffee, but bought a Bunn My Cafe that I am thrilled with because it brews at the right temperature, easily, and with no ecological waste.  One of the fun aspects of all this is trying out all sorts of coffee pods made by different companies.  Most of what I have tried so far are very good, so I have no complaints about any of them, but the Marley One Love coffee pod is perhaps my new favorite.  Wonderfully smooth coffee from Ethiopia, and from the moment you open the wrapper and smell the first whiff of heavenly coffee until you get to drink the freshly brewed cup you will not be disappointed.  This is going to become a regular order for me.  YUM!
2131	5	Our 2 tabbies are nuts for these chicken-flavored treats! (and ONLY these treats!)
2132	2	I first had this company's tea in Seattle.  It is a little shop at the famous open air market, Pike's Place.  I highly reccommend their Red Bush and Spice tea.  In fact, the Red Bush tea has 50 times the anti oxidants as green tea.<br /><br />The Huckleberry was a bit too fruity for me and the smell is overpowering in my storage cabinet.
2133	5	We love this cereal...but it is much cheaper when purchased directly from NaturesPath.com - the shipping cost here is outrageous.
2134	5	I have always hated red wine and the bitterness of it, but as someone previously mentioned, this wine is a perfect starter wine for those looking to get into red. It's sweet, not dry and tastes WONDERFUL! I highly recommend this bottle of wine for red beginners or just wine lovers in general. And yes it is a wine specific to Olive Garden but you can find it at local suppliers or online.
2135	1	I have been drinking really good Irish Breakfast tea for the past ten years and when my provider was backordered, I decided to give this tea a try since Irish Breakfast has to be Irish Breakfast right? Found out that this is not true with this tea. The tea comes well packaged and is very much a whole leaf tea but when I took a smell I smelled something that suggested it was tea. I immediately became worried and made a cup the next morning and soon discovered how bad the tea was. The tea has the orange color of Irish Breakfast but there is scarcely any aroma or flavor. The tea was very weak and it doesn't get any better by adding more leaves. I liked the idea of a subscription for tea but this one loses my vote.
2136	3	Tastes like white bread.  It is a little on the dry side, though.  I like a soft bread.  It is good for toast, though.  Oh how I miss Town Talk Bread!
2137	3	I dont want to order this if it the new recipe.  Can someone verify the one that is offerered is the original.<br /><br />thanks
2138	5	Bought four, 2 lb bags and use them to make bread and pizza dough. If you have fantacies of that perfect italian pizza you had  while touring through Italia, this flour is just the thing. The dough even smells slightly better, the final product produces the closest thing to that wonderful crust you can't find in the USA.  It's worth the dough, for the dough.
2139	2	I bought these because I wanted an energy/meal bar that tasted good. I love malt flavor so I was really excited to try these. There's a very light hint of chocolate/malt flavor but if it wasn't written on the package, I wouldn't have thought it tasted like malt at all. Basically, if you really like malt, this doesn't taste like it. The only upside is that it's a little larger than most energy bars and it's filling but the taste is pretty bland. The search continues! I think I'm going to try a oat and fruit bar next.
2140	5	My dogs favorite flavor.  No retail stores seem to carry it, anymore.  She is so happy to have her favorite food delivered on a regular basis!
2141	4	I use a lot of soy sauce in my kitchen. For one thing, I make a lot of stir fry dishes.  And a little soy sauce tops things off nicely once the vegetables and chicken (or whatever) are done and once the fried rice is ready to go.<br /><br />For another, sometimes I like to eat left over fried rice by itself.  Once again, some soy sauce added to the reheated rice is a delicious and simple snack.<br /><br />Kikkoman Soy Sauce, then, is a nice addition to one's pantry.
2142	5	When you want something sweet but don't want a big bag of cookies open next to you, here is the solution. These cookies taste great and the manufacturer cares about this world that we live in - a win/win buy!
2143	5	My wife loves it.  Me not so much.  It's just a taste preference thing.  I think I've been ruined by the apple ciders that are loaded with sugar, so this one tastes a little bland to me.  But it's probably how apple cider is meant to taste.  It smells great though!
2144	3	I fed this product to my cat and my roommate's cat.  I was experimenting with food since the cats are almost 1, and I wanted to introduce different kinds of adult food so they'd get used to them.  I mixed half Science Diet dry kitten food with this product, and the cats began to eat less.  I was worried about how much they were eating (nearly 1/4 their original diet) so I filled one bowl with this indoor cat food and one bowl with their kitten food.  They barely touched the indoor cat food, while eating most of their kitten food.  I ended up having to mix some canned cat food in with it to get them to eat.<br /><br />Part of it might be that the food is triangular and much larger than the kitten food.  They had a hard time eating it at first, since they were used to the small pieces of the kitten food.<br /><br />Don't be discouraged, though.  My cat can't tell the difference between the kitten food and the regular adult food.  They really enjoy Science Diet's fish flavored food, so give that a try.
2145	4	I hesitated to buy this item, becuase its Ingredients include a little bit sugar..<br />I don't like sugar products. If my baby get used to eating sugar, then he will try to eat sweet things.<br />Anyway.. He likes it. :)
2146	5	I only use the Colivata Extra Virgin Olive Oil - it's great for dressings, it's great to cook with - it has a mild flavor - it doesn't over-take the flavor of what you're cooking, but instead enhances it.
2147	5	I really love this maca powder.  It has a nice texture and tastes very good to me.  (I may be weird, but I like to take it in small amounts right off the spoon and love the taste.)  It's great in smoothies if you don't want to taste it.  Gives me energy and also energy of the root chakra kind if you know what I mean.  If your sex drive is low, give it a try for a few weeks and see what you think.  It seems to help with hormonal balance or something wonderful.  I take a spoon every day and sometimes skip a day or so if I can stand to, just to help my body stay responsive to the maca.  Wonderful stuff.  Keep it coming!  Is there such a thing as too much maca?
2148	5	I tried these Haribo Gummy Peaches in San Francisco and absolutely fell in love with them (they are so much better than peach rings!), but when I returned to my homestate of Oklahoma, I couldn't find these awesome Haribo Gummy Peaches anywhere. I even looked in north Texas- still couldn't find them.  But then a stroke of genius occurred, and I realized Amazon might just have those delectable treasures I discovered in SF, and what do you know- it did!  I really love these peaches! I separated mine into several ziplock baggies for convenience, and I have a couple of baggies at home and one at work and I gave one to my sister-in-law. They're delicious!
2149	5	I am recommending this skin detox tea<br />Only wish it was decaf<br /> flavor is a soft rosepetal blend<br />I sweeten it  to taste with stevia granules..
2150	5	I love the sugar free licorice and order them frequently.  This last order, the regular ones were sent, not the sugar free.  I contacted Amazon and they said that they would send me the sugar free ones without charge.  That was a couple of weeks ago and I have not recieved them yet.<br /><br />Susan
2151	4	I used to buy this sauce every time I saw it in the store, sometimes 5 or 6 cans at a time, because it wasn't so easy to find. I find the Hunts pasta sauces taste fresher than jarred sauces and are more flavorful too. But over a year ago, they changed the ingredients for the spicy style sauce. It used to be slightly peppery and spicy, but now it tastes like it might make a good base for chili or chili pasta or even a Mexican dish. Not bad, but definitely not an Italian flavored sauce.
2152	5	There isn't much to say when reviewing a candy that you like.  If you like them, you like them.  If you don't, you don't.  I like these and was disappointed to see that my local Sam's Club had quit carrying them.  The only place I had run across them recently was a mall candy store, where they were horribly over-priced.  It was nice to find them online at a good price.
2153	5	My senior kitty is able to digest this quality cat food.  Other brands were an issue in terms of an upset stomach and vomiting.  It is well worth the incremental cost for the peace of mind it brings.  Highly recommend!
2154	5	I began using The Sumatra blend after i had an amazing cup of coffee at a wedding and asked about it. Discovered it was a European coffee called Douwe Egbert. So when I found out they they were producing Senseo's blends, I was thrilled. Not disappointed<br />Great brew
2155	5	the blueberry flavor is amazing, works well w sparkling water or adding a dash of flavor to lemonade.<br />the product arrived fast and the price was great!
2156	5	This is the most economical way to buy yeast even if you only bake with it 6 times in a year.  Do the math comparing the cost of those little packets & you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />This is an "Instant" or "Rapid Rise" yeast which should not be confused with "Active Dry".  Active Dry is dried at a higher temperature & therefore more of the yeast cells are killed.  If using AD, you need to soak/activate it in warm water before adding to dry ingredients.  This is unnecessary with Instant yeast; add it directly to the flour.  You also need to use more AD because more of the yeast cells are dead.<br /><br />I store mine in a glass jar with a tight-fitting lid in the refrigerator.  I write the expiration date on a label stuck to the lid.  It has always stayed active beyond the expiration date.<br /><br />This is the yeast to use if you are using a bread machine.  You can use AD yeast but it's more convenient to just dump all the ingredients in to a bread machine and let it do the work.<br /><br />You can substitute Rapid Rise/Instant yeast in a recipe calling for Active Dry yeast.  Use about 25% less Rapid Rise/Instant than the recipe calls for.  Example:  The Active Dry packets usually contain about 2-1/4 tsp./.25 oz. so use 1-3/4 tsp. Instant/rapid Rise yeast if the recipe calls for 1 packet (2-1/4 tsp.) Active Dry.<br /><br />You can also substitute Active Dry for a recipe that calls for Instant/Rapid Rise.  Use about 25% more Active Dry than the recipe calls for.  Example:  Use 1-1/4 tsp. Active Dry if the recipe calls for 1 tsp. Instant.<br /><br />1 tsp. Active Dry = 3/4 tsp. Instant/Rapid Rise<br />1 tsp. Instant/Rapid Rise = 1 1/4 tsp. Active Dry<br />1 packet (2 1/4 tsp/.25 oz) Active Dry = 1 3/4 tsp. Instant/Rapid Rise<br /><br />Other yeast to consider:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KWEZTO">Red Star Baking Yeast, Vacuum Packed, 2-Pound</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NY31WW">Safmex Instant Yeast ( 16 oz / 1 lb )</a>
2157	5	Hickory smoked crunchy almonds are served in KLM's economy class, but I couldn't find the same almonds so far although I checked all hickory smoked almonds by famous brands. Now I finally found. This is the taste I was looking for more than 2 years. The best Hickory smoked almonds I ever tried.
2158	5	I have never bought this cereal from Amazon and highly doubt that I'd ever will for the price that they are asking. However, the cereal is really awesome. I love how many different foods they have in here and yet it still works! It is really fun to eat; wondering what I'll get in the next serving batch. The fact that it is healthy makes me love it even more.
2159	5	Like most people I don't always have time to cook up something tasty and healthy so I kinda' cheat by having a few of these in my desk or bag. The numbers are really good and it doesn't taste like other protein-fiber-board bars that I have had in the past. I was genuinely surprised how good the chocolate almond tasted.
2160	5	like my title says, this is the best ghee on the market... it's fantastic! grass fed, organic, what more could you ask for? oh, right... it's delicious!!
2161	5	This is really good tuna. The quality is good and the flavor is exceptional. I hope it is restocked soon. I had to order the 3 ounce cans instead. I will definitely sign up for auto-ship if this becomes available again. Makes great tuna sandwiches with just a little lemon and salt and pepper.
2162	5	This is the best jarred pasta sauce that I have ever tasted. It has a strong olive flavor, which I enjoyed immensely.
2163	2	I also has a subscription for this item.... I have cancelled it because the last few times they have been stale and very hard. Too bad because I love the product.
2164	5	Santa brought both this Rawhide ring and the rawhide knot by the same manufacturer for my dogs, a Catahoula who LOVES to chew, and my docile Shepherd mix who hasn't shown much interest in anything other than food and sleeping on the couch.  Both the ring and the know were a BIG hit with both dogs; the ring more so than the knot.  They both settled down quickly with these chews, after investigating what the other one had.  The Cata worked on the ring for a bit, and when she put it down, the Shep quickly picked it up and abandoned the knot.  I thought this might cause a fight, but the Cata simply picked up the knot instead.  The ring seemed to be easier for them to manuver in a comfy position, and was definitely preferred over the knot, but both were big hits.  I will be purchasing more of these in the future.
2165	5	These are amazing! Great tasting, low in calorie and carbs, and I got a lot of packs for a great deal.
2166	5	AMAZING chips.  I picked them up at Whole Paycheck, and as soon as I'd had a few, I ran to Amazon to see if I could buy them by the carton!<br /><br />I believe I have never tasted a better chip of any sort.<br /><br />They're lighter and crisper than the usual kinds of tortilla chips that come in brown paper bags, and they have the taste of olive oil, black pepper, salt and olives.<br /><br />I ate them right out of the bag, but I could see them working well with some kinds of pate or hummus, too.<br /><br />The main down side:  one 6oz bag contains 840 calories, and they're quite addicting.
2167	5	Just wish they could keep it in stock.  I guess I will have to order more next time it is in!
2168	2	I'm not nearly as taken with Orbit's Fruitini gum as I am with some of their other flavors.  Some of their flavors are fantastic, and Orbit gum generally has a nice consistency to chew, but there's something off about this flavor.  I'm pretty sure the culprit is the whitening agents.  Not all Orbit gum claims to whiten, but this is one of the flavors that does, and I think you can taste the whitening agents in the gum.  This gum does taste like fruit, but there's a weird undertone- what I suspect to be the whitening agents.  My advice would be to try a stick before committing to a whole large pack, or go with one of Orbit's other flavors- I recommend the Sangria and the Melon-Mint.
2169	5	I've eaten this mustard for years and find it to be one of the best available. Yes, it's hard to find but is worth the effort. It is spicy and robust but goes really well with a great hot dog, Virginia ham, or roast beef sandwich. This product has been around for a long time cause it's that good. Keep demanding it so they'll keep making it.
2170	3	Was looking for a dressing mix different from our usual Good Seasonings Italian dressing for a change of pace.  This is ok, but not as flavorful as I would expect from a Knorr product.  Also, all directions are in Swiss? German?  A translation sticker on the package would've been nice.
2171	5	My dogs love them.  They don't last very long with the larger dog. Will order more some time. Good price.
2172	5	We as a population are so lucky to have so many different tastes and flavors.  One of those tastes and flavors is Nielsen-Massey Pure Almond Extract.  I is on a par as Nielsen-Massey Pure Vanilla Extract and frankly I cannot tell any difference between the two in terms of quality.  Each has characteristics that make any cooking or baking the best possible.  Sure I can buy imitation flavors and I will see and taste the difference between the real and imitation.  A recent Almond Pound Cake was ingested so fast at a desert fair the folks wanted more.  I have found that any Nielsen-Massey (N-M)flavor is consistently fantastic and never overstated.  Some flavors cannot be detected because they disappear when cooked but not so with N-M.  This set of flavors is a must have when the time comes.  Highly recommended.
2173	5	Hands-down the best gluten-free brownie mix I've tried.  As good as "regular" brownie mixes!  I wouldn't hesitate to serve this to friends/family.  Though I've got to say, they're usually not around long enough to do so.  In fact, I have to fight my husband for them.<br /><br />Thanks, King Arthur!  These brownies really hit the spot when I'm having a chocolate craving (which happens regularly)!  :-)
2174	2	I bought these since the Gevalia discs were all recalled. Definite taste difference. These taste more burnt and less silky but they get the job done until the Gevalia ones come back in stock.
2175	5	I already own the handpresso traveling kit and it probably is one of the best gadgets I have ever owned<br /><br />When we are traveling it is so nice to have access to good coffee so when I saw this item and read what it did I naturally had to have it its kind of like a update for the handpresso unit<br />I cant wait to try it out there are going to be some jealous people around when they smell the fresh espresso (LOL)
2176	2	In my opinion these are a poor substitute for a "real" pretzel. They have a potato-y taste and an odd texture. They're crunchy when you first bite into them. Then they quickly dissolve; not very quickly, just more quickly than "real" pretzels.<br /><br />So far Snyder's gluten free pretzels are the closest thing to "real" pretzels I have tried yet. I just wish they were made in twists.
2177	5	It is  hard to find PURE juice of any kind at a reasonable price but here is one that fits the bill.Remember, this is pure cherry juice  not from concentrate. It is also NOT organic,which is about $14.00 more. As it is this is a fine tart juice and being pure is full of antioxidants and anti- inflamationary properties and great for mixing with any of the other juices(red)from the fine Lakewood line.This or organic?Your move.
2178	5	It's got a nice taste and comes in different flavors.  I mix it with water and it makes for a tasty drink.  For the price, it is very much worth it.
2179	5	Our dogs are 7 and 11 years so they need the extra vitamins to help them move freely.  This product does the trick.
2180	5	I loved the Muffin Mix.  It was tasty and easy to adapt to my vegetarian diet.................meaning I used soy milk and soy butter to make it.
2181	4	These are just like they were when I was young!  I will be ordering them once again when they have a free shipping offer.
2182	1	Wanted to like it, but doesn't taste like apple cider.  About a dozen people use this machine and nobody drinks it.  What does that tell you?
2183	4	These are great. They won't cure cancer or solve world hunger, but they're good dragees.<br /><br />One complaint: They arrived in a plain, unlabelled plastic container. The legal disclaimer on the page here says (paraphrasing) "Don't trust this web page, trust the product packaging, for ingredients, etc." But there is no product packaging, no label.
2184	3	These chips are nice and crisp with out being too hard. The taste is somewhat bland and does not taste much like parmesan, but it they still make for a decent snack.
2185	5	These delicious bars have a nice chewy texture.  The kids love these and so do I even though they are not as sweet as most other 'health' bars and contain no cane sugar or corn syrup. (I often pick out the raisins myself which isn't hard to do.)  They are a very good deal through Amazon.
2186	5	This grain free food is very good. It rate by other site very well as well. The dogs seem to enjoy the food and the coats look better.  I highly recommended it.
2187	3	My dog is a bit shy about eating in front of people, so I should have known that he would not like these.  He didn't.  He looked at me like I was crazy.  I tried to make him try it, but he resisted and then I felt bad about doing it.<br /><br />One time during a bad storm he was hiding under my desk and he licked it and seemed to like it, but I haven't got him to do it since.<br /><br />I think the product is probably good - and there's a lot in it and it looks safe enough - it's like a deodorant roller ball - but my dog is just too shy.<br /><br />My cat liked it.  I wasn't sure how good it was for cats though so I didn't let her try it again.  They should make these for cats though - I had a cat that would lick her fur off, this would have been great to help divert her.<br /><br />It's a lot neater to keep in your pocket than regular treats.  It would be great for training a dog if you had a dog that would lick it.
2188	5	Wings made with this seasoning are perfect; so delicious! A few prep. ideas: 1. Coat your wings  in a reusable container, not a plastic bag. 2. Line the baking sheet with oiled parchment rather than aluminum foil; better results, easier clean-up. So good; not too spicy. Glad it's available through Amazon because it's becoming hard to find at the store. Yum!
2189	5	Market Spice Tea is the name of the signature blend and the tea company that has been producing it since the early 1900's in Pike Place Market in Seattle. It is black tea flavored with cinnamon, orange peel and essential oils. It is naturally sweet but contains no sugar or sweetener.<br /><br />Many people who don't like tea, love it. It is very fragrant and is great hot or iced. If you are used to drinking black tea with no flavor or sweetener you may prefer to blend it with a plain black tea as it is a very strongly flavored tea. Taste it before sweetening it.<br /><br />You should buy it in small quantities because it contains no preservatives and the citrus oils can go "off" after six months or so. You should also make sure not to store it or serve it in plastic or styrofoam as the citrus oils react with them.
2190	5	I have been using this coffee since purchasing my Keurig B60 brewer. It is a great tasting flavored coffee which I start my day with. I drink anywhere from 2 to 5 cups a day depending on what I'm doing. I spend 6 to 10 hours a day on the internet marketing and the coffee helps me get through the day. I highly recommend this coffee for anyone who likes a great cup of delicious coffee.
2191	5	I love this flavor of Kind bars. They taste sinful, but are delicious. I would definitely buy this flavor again.
2192	4	Prior to ordering on Amazon, I purchased the canned tomatoes from the local grocery stores. Thus, I am familiar with and like Muir products as a whole. Overall, you pay a few cents more per can than the local grocery stores (of course that depends on geographic location). The only complaint about my order is one of the cans was dented. Unlike other grocery items that I have purchased from Amazon, this order actually was packed correctly and arrived without anything spilling out. The only warning I have for customers ordering food via Amazon is to be aware of cheap packaging by Amazon.
2193	1	This participial tuna comes in a tiny 3 oz can. It is grossly overpriced. You get a better Italian tuna at the Trader Joes, in a bigger can and without skimping on the olive oil.
2194	5	I tried this on a road trip when we stopped off in Omaha, Nebraska. I asked a worker at the Durham Museum what the flavor was like and she said 'its root beer with a more bitter flavor.' I tried it and was amazed that it tasted homemade, was less sweet, and better than all the other root beers on the market. I couldn't find this flavor in my hometown so I ordered it on Amazon unsure of how well Boylan's would package it. It arrived in a small box that I thought would have lots of bubble wrap in it but was pleasantly surprised when I found two perfectly die cut styrofoam pieces holding the 12 bottles in place on the top and bottom. I'm finally enjoying this Birch Beer once again!
2195	4	What you see is what you get....not a stunning variety, but adequate. There are 12 each of four different kinds: 12 Tullys French Roast, 12 Caribou Blend, 12 Newmans Blend, and 12 Green Mountain Nantucket Blend. Nothing out of the ordinary or exciting but a solid way to restock a collection with some variety for different tastes.
2196	4	I am a real estate agent and I sent this to one of my clients this year for the holidays. From the sound of their feedback when they called me, they loved it. They were eating it as they were talking to me, actually. I never saw the product, but I can tell you that the people that received it seemed to really love it.
2197	5	As my wife and I found we had become "those people" who stop at the local coffee shop many times a week, we needed to hit the lotto, quit or buy a machine and learn to make our own go-juice.<br /><br />This coffee brews wonderfully in our new DeLonghi Bar32 (EC155 clone) - the fine grind makes the cheezy built-in tamper more than good enough, reducing counter-clutter. And the crema produced is a dream - though the fancy, much older, espresso machine at work can't hope to achieve this with me driving it --- the DeLonghi is just newbie-proof and brews this blend really really nicely.<br /><br />Though she was initially disappointed I didn't splurge on the illy to christen the new machine, she likes the lattes we're making at home more than her $3 coffee shop favorite. This blend is fine for my mocha, too, though if she didn't LOVE this coffee I'd give the Rossa a whirl looking for just a little stronger flavor to stand up with the cocca powder. Frankly - this is making as good a mocha as what I buy at any of my 3 shops, so I'm happy too!<br /><br />Glad I trusted the reviews. I just signed up for a "subscription" - can't beat the price!
2198	5	Although, I am not a vegetarian I love this chili.  It is delicious even eaten right out of the can with a spoon.  I have enjoyed it, having found it many years ago, but have not been able to find it very often.  Until I did a 'google' search for it and found it from 'Amazon'.  Now I can order a case of it whenever I run out.  PTL  &lt;>&lt;
2199	4	I love Oetker boxed Creme Brulee.  It is soooo easy to whip up when guests are coming, and it has a wonderful taste.  A simple dessert you can make quickly and, just by adding fresh fruit or mint leaves on top, etc., you have a dessert that looks like a chef made!
2200	5	<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E29A">Stonewall Kitchen Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle Mix, 33-Ounce Cans (Pack of 2)</a><br /> The family said they were the best that I had made. The 10 Grandchildren ate all that was served to them.<br />The parents, who I have served pancakes to for a long, also said they were the best they have eaton. It was good to see the little ones clean up their plates.
2201	5	Tried this product to reduce the itching and licking behaviors that have plagued my two dogs. One dog was scratching so bad, he sounded like "Thumper" and has had surgery two times to heal wounds caused by the licking. The other dog has a history of ear problems. Within a week, the dog with the itching problem stopped scratching, and both dogs stopped licking their paws.  The dog with the ear problems hasn't had symptoms (shaking and digging at his ear)since we started this food in December 2011. The jury is still out on that one sinced Spring has not yet sprung, but this is a potential outcome I had not expected.<br /><br />Overall, I am very pleased with the results of the grain-free diet. One negative is that the older dog has very bad dog farts at times. Whew! I would like to see a grain-free for seniors! I don't mind the increased cost, especially since it is offset by their improved health, fewer visits to the vet, and the fact that they eat half as much.<br /><br />Now, fellow humans....if this is what grains do to dogs, what do we think is going on with our diets?????
2202	4	We have a picky dog and this is the only food he will eat. Thanks
2203	5	I think PG tips are my favorite black tea. Its such a delicious tea. No wonder its Englands number one brand.
2204	1	I have ordered my Pop Chips from Amazon for months. The last boxful was nasty. My whole family agreed and we threw them out. They tasted old and rancid. I wrote this to Amazon and never heard a word back about it. I just cancelled my regular delivery.
2205	5	I bought these for my mom, to help with the nausea she feels with migraines -- they actually DO help. Now I carry them around, too, for hypoglycemia incidents. Work on minor car-sickness, as well. Or one can eat them recreationally :). Not too sweet, a bit spicy, totally yummy.<br /><br />NOTE: Avoid the mango-flavored version -- unutterably disgusting. But the orange and plain are great.
2206	5	I love this cocoa powder. Found it first at Bob's Red Mill and then here on Amazon for less. I use this several times a week for Peanut Butter and Chocolate Protein Shakes. Super Yummy! I also love that it's almost caffeine free, because I'm sensitive to some chocolates and caffeine.
2207	5	...it would not dissolve fully.  Product from local grocery dissolved fine, but what I bought from Amazon left chunks of product in the iced tea.  Very strange.  But do buy this product somewhere!  No glycemic index, no carbs, no calories.  Splenda and even other stevia products can't match those stats!  Cheers!
2208	2	I don't want to be over-negative here -- this product will definitely meet the specific needs of some folks such as those who have little time or, college students who live by microwave cooking. But for the average consumer, this product has some clear drawbacks. There are five facets to my evaluation: ease of preparation, flavor, health aspects/portion size, environmental concerns, and storage, (I'm not including price, which people can weigh for themselves) so I'll enumerate my observations here:<br /><br />1. Preparing the dish is a bit of a pain, compared to the Healthy Choice frozen dinners. It's essentially a five-step process, although I did find it necessary to additionally microwave the "finished" dish for an extra 30 seconds. I found it difficult to read the instructions on the side and on the top due to the tiny font size, but young people will probably not experience this problem. Microwaving the sauce can generate a tiny mess because you pull back a corner of the packet to allow steam to escape and mine bubbled out slightly. So, I did have to go back and wipe out the microwave with a damp rag. The water fill line is lightly stamped into the clear plastic and is near impossible to see initially -- you really have to look for it (on each end). The manufacturer would have benefited the consumer by putting larger font instructions on a removable card on the top so that one could just stick it under a refrigerator magnet to see what to do at each step; however, once you've prepared this dish the first time, it would be easy to do a second time without instructions.<br /><br />2. My wife and I both tried the product and we came to essentially the same conclusion... it's not nearly as tasty as the Healthy Choice frozen dinners, which we like very much. The pasta comes out remarkably well, au dente, very tasty. Of course, "taste" is very subjective and we are pretty discriminating so I'll just say this: if you think that McDonald's hamburgers taste pretty good, you'll probably be okay with the taste of this dish. With the sauce, the dish has a fennel-Italian sausage ambiance and it's not at all bland. I'm not a vegetarian but, honestly, I think they'd have been better off to go with a meatless marinara sauce for broader appeal and better flavor.<br /><br />3. The product (entire dish) has 340 calories, 6 grams of fat, and 2 grams of saturated fat. The dry weight is 6.95 ounces. In terms of portion size, I weigh 280 pounds and I'm a big eater -- the portion size was plenty large enough for me and the meal was hearty to the degree that I was not hungry again an hour later.<br /><br />4. Environmentally, this baby is a bit of a nightmare. While the plastics are mostly of the recyclable type, most people who typically recycle plastic beverage bottles are probably not going to recycle this -- I didn't bother (even though I recycle a LOT of plastics, glass, and paper) because it takes more hot water to wash/rinse out the two plastic bowls and the lid than the plastic is worth -- in other words, in terms of energy use, this packaging is a loser. Unfortunately, I can see no other way to set it up -- the manufacturer has already reduced the necessary components to the least number possible.<br /><br />5. The best aspect of this product is that it's very convenient to store, no refrigeration required, and the bowls stack nicely. The manufacturer's "use by" date extends for about a year, although I suspect that it would keep even longer than that under ideal dry storage conditions.<br /><br />To summarize, you could slightly improve the flavor of this dish (which would also boost the calories and the fat content) by sprinkling some freshly grated Parmesan cheese over the top of it. But the bottom line is this... even though it would take longer, I would much prefer boiling a little of my own pasta and using some canned spaghetti sauce, warmed in the microwave, OR, I would recommend buying the Healthy Choice frozen dinners which are much more convenient to prepare and tastes remarkably superior to this product.
2209	3	I like many Newman's Own products and love the concept--that all the profits go to such worthy causes including a camp for children with cancer.<br /><br />And ginger snaps are one of my favorite cookies, so I was happy when this product showed up on Vine. It's nice to be able to give a positive review to a product whose sale benefits so many people. Organic flour and organic sugar were examples of quality ingredients in use.<br /><br />So, imagine my disappointment when the bag arrived. Its a cute bag of cookies, and about 30 cookies with a removable tape to help seal it so they stay crisp. The first one I tried had a good snap and a strong ginger flavor--which I really liked and think ginger cookies should have. It also had the right balance of sweetness--some, but not too much.<br /><br />The second cookie was so different. One, crisp and fresh tasting; the other chewy (not in a good way) and a bit flat tasting. I thought maybe it was just a weird "odd" one in the batch, but...no. About half the cookies are one way, half the other. And they even look different--lt brown v. dark brown, curved like a vanilla wafer v. flat as the proverbial pancake. They seemed a bit over-baked and the after taste was not burned, exactly, but not pleasant.<br /><br />I thought maybe this was packaged just for Vine, but...no, it seems to be just the regular product. They're not inedible, they are made with organic flour and sugar, and they do go to a good cause. Just be prepared for the inconsistency and maybe use the kind you -don't- like to eat for baking or cooking. I ground up the flat ones to use with a pie (they'd be good on ice cream, too).
2210	5	This is my first time experimenting with coconut oil and I am very pleased. I've used it in cookies and brownies and they have turned out amazing. I would that that when I make cookies, I melt the oil instead of creaming it with the sugar like you would butter.<br /><br />I've used it on my hand when they dry and crack and it works very well and smells wonderful.<br /><br />I've also used the oil for a stir-fry and in some basmati rice and both turned out wonderfully.<br /><br />0 Cholesterol is an added bonus to the wonderful taste it adds to dishes.
2211	5	Simple, uncomplicated and healthy ingredients. Cooked in expeller pressed oils (not heated to extract, which causes loss of nutritional value), Kettle chips have a firmer texture than most others, but they have great flavor, even though no flavor enhancers are used except for the spices. No preservatives is also a plus. My only negative experience with them is an occasional bag in which the chips in the very bottom of the bag are oily. I was so pleased to find them at a price nearly a third less than what I have been paying in the grocery market.
2212	5	Delmonte products are always a dependable part of any meal.  With just my husband and myself at the dinner table it is a perfect size at 8 oz.  It is also a blessing to find the products with pull tab openings for those of us with a bit of stiffness in our hands.
2213	5	got the product fast.  Was very pleased.  Gave them to family. They thought they were great too. I do this every year. They can't live without this hot chocolate.
2214	3	First off, these taste wonderful.  However, they crumble which is very annoying.<br /><br />Mine came fully intact but as I take each one out of plastic wrap inside the tubing, they just crumble in my hand before I can get them to my mouth!  Almost seems like they are too fresh and need some time to firm up!<br /><br />Found an easy solution - I just emptied the entire contents into the tube they came in and I just drink them.  LOL
2215	5	I have a brother and sister that are 10 years old.  They love this food and it appears to keep them in good shape.  They are very active and you would never know they are 10.
2216	5	I nevr tasted 100% Ethiopian Yirgacheffe before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. But this really surprised me. There was none. No taste. Just tan water.  When I put the packet into the pod brewer, what came out was not coffee. I couldn't believe it. Not from Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee. No way, mon.  I didn't name my dog Stanley Marley for nothing.  I'm a believer.  I took another pod, cut it open and poured the contents into a K-cup and gave the Keurig Brewer a try. What a difference.  The fragrance was enough to bring me to my knees.  The taste?  You know how coffee is supposed to taste but mostly doesn't?  That's how it tastes.  Rich, deep coffee notes, almost a smokiness, but not heavy...this is a lively brew.  There is a definite that makes you want to gulp the whole cup. But sip it...it's too good to gulp.<br /><br />After that first experiment, I opened 3 more pods and poured the contents into the Boodum.  Not the right grind, so I ended up with tons of grounds in the cup but the flavor? Even better.  That rich coffee taste with absolutely no bitterness, no sour aftertaste. I had the Keurig version black, and tasted the Boodum mug first with nothing, then with regular milk, and then poured a cup and added one scant tablespoon of condensed milk.  All of them were wonderful.  Of course I did not sleep for 3 days, but you have to make sacrifices for the sake of science.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend the coffee, but not the carrier. Don't order the pods, order the whole bean or ground, loose coffee.  This is an excellent brew when it is released from Pod Prison. It has that beautiful deep, almost turkish coffee flavor going for it.  Black it revs you up, but with milk, cream or condensed milk, it is pure sipping pleasure.  This is Sunday morning, sit back, read the newspaper, put your feet up, life is wonderful coffee.  No fooling.<br /><br />And just for the record, one of the reviewers who gave this product a single star felt that it was bitter and too strong.  I don't know what sort of weak-kneed coffee set that standard, but if you are using the pod, there is no way this could be too strong.  The same reviewer also added "flavored coffee creamer" to the cup.  That stuff is just awful. The 'flavors' are crude and artificial and probably made from petroleum byproducts, recycled plastic bags and zoo waste.  Add real cream, no problem. Add flavors...real cinnamon, cardamom, a little red pepper even.  Nutmeg brings out the inner soul of most coffee, it's lovely. If it's a spice and smells like dessert, it will work.  You can melt a cube of dark chocolate in the microwave and stir it in. Even better, smoosh up a Peppermint Patty and pour the coffee over that. Chocolaty, pepperminty goodness that is like Christmas in a cup.  Flavor your coffee any way you like, but not the fake stuff.  But with this coffee, you don't need to monkey around.  It's that good. Just nix the pod.
2217	5	This is really good stuff, they are a bit soft but I got a number of pieces that gave my jaw an exercise ;p The flavor cannot be beat! (sweet and hot). I also bought the bbq flavored one but I'll finish this one first :)
2218	5	This seasoning just gives hamburgers that added touch,i recomend using this at your next barbeque and inpress your friends and they will come back for more.
2219	4	I have a three month old pug puppy who is incredibly food motivated.  Carrying around treats on a walk while I'm leash training him can be a hassle to fish out without spilling the rest or getting crumbs in my pockets.  We received a free sample of Lickety Stik at our puppy training class because of a pug's tendency to pack on the pounds and I was really surprised at how quickly the puppy took to it.  He will do tricks and readily follow on the leash to get a lick of this treat and becomes excited when he sees the bottle.<br /><br />The main drawback to this thing is that it stinks to high heaven and if I get a strong whiff of it the thing makes me gag.  The dog loves it, however so I am really considering buying more of this product in the future.
2220	5	This green tea is delicious. My new diet calls for green tea or coffee only. I am not a coffee drinker and usually drink ice tea. This green tea is perfect hot or cold! I use Stevia and it taste perfect. With the cooler months upon us, this will make a great hot drink to sip on...not to mention the benefits of green tea! Buy it...you won't be disappointed!
2221	5	Great gluten free bread, but they put an odd number of slices in each pack. This means that you always end up with just one slice left after making two sandwichs.
2222	3	I picked up the Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink to take to work and give a boost to my water consumption. Who couldn't use a bit more vitamin C or energy? While there is some nutritional value in the vitamin content, the drink is also loaded with artificial ingredients. The caffeine content, alone, seems counterintuitive to something that wants to market itself as healthful. So, I'm not sure that Vitamin Squeeze has exactly figured out which niche in the marketplace it wants to fulfill. Health or energy? By making claims to both, it also falls short of either.<br /><br />The one thing I did like is that the bottle is much bigger than other water additives (heck, the waste of plastic and processing on those tiny bottles drives me insane). The instructions say that you add a squeeze to 8 ounces of water. That would make 24 servings in the bottle supposedly. One problem, a squeeze isn't a real unit of measurement. With too little, there is no taste at all and if you use enough to notice--you'll probably only end up with 8-10 servings. The taste, even with extra squeezing, is like diluted sugar free kool-aid. It's not awful, but it has a pronounced aftertaste. If you're looking for a caffeine supplement, you might find this appealing enough. But it's not something that I would revisit for either the vitamins or the caffeine. KGHarris, 6/12.
2223	4	best low calorie chip yet.  hard to tell that they are baked.  very, very good!!
2224	4	Mariani's Tropical Medley of dried fruits is a delicious mix.  My kids and I absolutely love it.  There are all kinds of different colors, flavors,and textures here, as the medley includes pineapple, apricots, papaya, raisins, golden raisins, apples, and coconut.  I would have given this product five stars, but it does have added sugar and yellow dye number 6.  Still, it's a great snack and a far better choice for a sweet craving than candy!
2225	5	Very happy to see they still do make this. When I saw it, I wanted some. When I saw the "Subscribe And Save" price, I ordered. Not as sugary as you might think, contains less sugar (and more vitamins) per serving than some "health conscious" cereals.
2226	5	Candy Corn is the ultimate Halloween candy.  It's almost a shame I haven't actually had any in years.  Oh but the memories- the memories of Halloween night, trick or treating around town and having small bags of candy corn thrown in my bag.  Always the first thing I'd eat when I got home and emptied my bag all over the floor.  Towards the end of my candy corn eating days however, I noticed that the taste had been exchanged for a more sugar-only catastrophe.  Hopefully the company that produces these candies has rebounded with a mighty fine tasting product for the Halloween kids this year who certainly deserve the wonderful type that I grew up with.
2227	5	holistic select is extremely healthy for your dog. it is extremely healthy and recommended by vets.<br /><br />my dog is strong and healthy because of the food he eats
2228	4	I enjoyed this coffee. Had a good flavor with no after taste and no heart burn. Aroma was nice. My friends also enjoeyed it. This was not overwhelmingly strong or bitter. I thought it had a great flavor for a great price. Keep in mind it is half the caf and exactly what I was looking for. I would certainly buy again at the price I got it. Thanks Amazon!
2229	4	despite my four stars i really do like this product. it has a thicker consistancy than  almond milk without the artificial thickeners. i really like the fact that this is another way to get omega 3's and 6's in your diet without swallowing another pill. the only thing is that it does have a "grassy" after taste.
2230	5	I have been giving these treats to my dogs for the past 3 years or so. Never upset their stomachs and every time I say a word with "tion" on the end they get so excited.<br />Great products, great ingredients and above all a very trustworthy company!
2231	3	I didn't care for this blend because for a extra bold, it had a weak taste.  Its hard to explain but a bold and extra bold has a dark, rich taste to it, and this blend was disappointing.  I was just missing that bold flavor.  It tasted like McDonald's coffee that has been sitting for an hour.  The smell was also weak.
2232	5	Thanks Amazon and Pamela's! My 15 yr old son eats gluten free and loves these cookies.  He can eat an entire bag when he gets home from school and it was driving us in to the poor house buying them at the local grocery store.  Thanks to Amazon and the auto ship program I am saving almost $2 a bag by ordering them this way!  They are great tasting cookies....they taste like chocolate chip cookies should taste...with or without gluten!
2233	1	I was incredibly disappointed.  I used an entire jar and the product still did not have any taste.  I won't be buying again.
2234	5	Great flavor...smells terrific when brewing......and really gives you a raspberry chocolate candy taste
2235	5	Great Coffee, close to the "leaded' version and better than most.  Glad I can at least get it through Amazon!
2236	4	The product itself is great.  However, it arrived with some of the jars broken and pear everywhere.  It was a mess!  It definitely needs better packaging before it is shipped.
2237	5	Another fabulous dry cat food with 40% protein and cats love it.<br /><br />Why did Amazon just raise the price from $10.99 to $15.33 or 39.4% for a 6-pound bag???<br /><br />This is the same thing they did with Taste of the Wild which was just raised over 60%.<br /><br />Inflation, yes but not hyper-inflation, YET.
2238	4	I love these things. Never really liked killing things until now. Living in So Cal there aren't a lot of gophers per yard but when ever they pop up I set a trap and bam, caught another. They don't kill the gopher though. Just drop them in a bucket of water and walk away if you don't want to see them gasp. Would get five stars if it was easier to get them out of the trap. I just caught two this weekend and one was a half hour after setting the trap. About to order two more packs
2239	5	I'd never realised how refined even non-instant porridge oats are. These are definitely not: they're round and nutty and take thirty minutes to cook, which, in our house, makes them better suited to weekend breakfasts. My children are a little reluctant to eat anything so obviously healthy, but I love them.
2240	5	It is nice to find unsweetened bottled tea.  Can be a little strong, but over ice it is great.  Need to drink cold.
2241	1	Due to all the publicity surrounding the questionable quality of dried chicken strips from China, I have thrown out this order (it is not worth the money to return it).  I will not be reordering them.  I will only be ordering dog treats made in the USA.
2242	5	For such a cheap product, given that im used to paying 45$ plus a pound for the best of the best, this coffee is the absolute best stuff I have yet to purchase, even far more so than the very expensive jamaican blues and Maui. I was extremely shocked at how very sweet and mellow this coffee is, and found it to be the very best choice for making iced coffee, and I have tried them all as pertains iced coffee. I will be buying a ton of this stuff in the future, its utterly fantastic.
2243	4	I don't like fake sugar flavor and I don't like things to be super sweet.  I'm tough to please in the beverage department.  But, these little iced tea things make the cut!  They dissolve easily, even at the office without a spoon to use to stir and the flavor is light and sweet, not cloying and artificial.  I do use a bit more water than the package recommends, but I find this product pleasing and excellent!
2244	4	Not one of my Stash favorites but it's supposed to be good for you so I bought it.  It's a bit too fruity and sweet for my taste but if that's what you like than this tea is for you.
2245	1	I'm allergic to aspartame and have bad kidney problems after drinking it unknowingly.  I ordered this product and would not have if it had said SUGAR FREE.  I would've had a clue that I couldn't drink it.  Ingredient labeling should be mandatory.  It certainly wasn't advertised correctly and completely wasted my money.  Buyer beware.
2246	5	Guys: Although this may not have the exact taste of a typical commercial brand peanut butter out of the jar, it is VERY CLOSE.  THIS IS THE ONE THAT SATISFIES A CRAVING FOR CREAMY PEANUT BUTTER without all the fatty oil.. It has no chemical or weird aftertaste (it's the most peanut-nutty tasting alternative out there which I've tried), and you really can adjust the consistency based on the amount of liquid you add.  Although  I previously favored the "Better-n-Peanut Butter" brand sold here <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KUQG3O">Better N Peanut Butter, Better N Peanut Butter, Orig Lf, 16.00 OZ (Pack of 12)</a>and at Trader Joe's (which needs no mixing or preparation and has a real peanut butter texture), I must admit that the taste of "better n peanut butter" is not nearly as good as PB2 ( "Better n Peanut Butter" is less peanut-y and does have an odd sort of after taste) and it needs to be refrigerated after opening or it gets moldy (trust me.....yuck).<br /><br />Anyway, back to this product:PB2.  It has a very good peanut buttery taste and if you're cooking with it or mixing it in drinks or smoothies (like a banana smoothie), the texture is a non-issue. And having it in these 1 lb packages makes it much more affordable than buying the small jars sold here or directly from PB2's website (where they add $10 shipping).  And if you get at least three bags at Amazon, it qualifies for free shipping (it works out to about $8.70/lb). I also ordered the chocolate which is also good (not a strong chocolatey taste, more like a hint of cocoa), but my favorite is still the plain PB2.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br />Guys: I just tried another product from Byrd Mill and searched under peanut flour product (basically peanut butter with the oils removed as well) that's also very good  (it's cheaper than the PB2 product here if you buy the 5 1lb. option....I ordered -1- 5 lb bag and the total price with shipping was approx. $32.65 (therefore about $6.50/lb). The package comes in about 4 days after you order, but the one negative is that it is not vacuum sealed.  It's in a plastic bag with a twisty tied around it and then placed in a large paper bag with a folding top (the kind of bag that coffee beans come in, but bigger). In order to keep it fresh, I use about 1 lb. at a time and then vacuum seal the rest.  They also sell larger and smaller quantities at slightly steeper discount with little change in shipping. You have an option of getting a dark roast (more peanut-y) or light roast (less peanut-y tasting) and either 28% fat left in (at 6g/serving) or 12% (at 3g fat per serving).  I buy the dark roasted, 12% fat.  It is definitely more peanut-y than PB2 and is smoother and creamier in texture. The only big difference from the PB2 product (which I prefer, others may not....) is that Byrd Mill does not have any salt and sugar added (it's just pure roasted de-fatted peanut flour) so you'll most definitely want to add a little salt (maybe even a little honey) to the mixture to suit your taste if your using it plain (like on a sandwich, or with crackers or right on a spoon.  So if you find yourself snacking on peanut butter every day to satisfy your peanut butter cravings, go ahead and try this.
2247	5	excellent puppy food my dog is now a year and a half and on the adult Mini highly recommend Royal Canin and it is available in Europe should you travel
2248	4	The beer is the best of three brands i have sampled.  The cans are 330 ml which is not 12 oz as the product description says.
2249	5	I can honestly say that these shots are sometimes crutches for me when I feel like I'm about to just pass out. I'm majoring in Mechanical Engineering and these things are PHENOMENAL for when you need to get some late night studying done, or if you need some energy to focus on exams. It takes about ~20 minutes for me to feel the effects, and it lasts for 3-4 hours for me. I feel only slightly jittery, but there's a significant difference in the amount of focus you get from a 5 hour energy than your regular energy drink. I suppose the B vitamins are to thank for that! And of course, the best part... NO CRASH! I highly recommend these if you are a college student. They are VERY beneficial and will give you that extra boost and focus you need!
2250	4	You can't go wrong with these if you're a fan of black licorice. They have a mild licorice flavor and I was surprised by how many people I shared them with were so entertained and amused by their simple doggie shapes.
2251	5	I love these potato chips.  I've been eating Season's potato chips for years.  When I buy the unsalted ones, I add a little salt on my own.  They're cooked with peanut oil, which doesn't leave the slight aftertaste that many oils other than this and canola oil do, in my experience. These chips have a great mouth 'feel',light and crisp, not too hard or crunchy.  I highly recommend giving them a try.
2252	1	I ordered this lavender to use in ice cream. Because of all the stems, leaves and husks I had to strain the ice cream after extracting the lavender flavor during the cooking. After spreading out two tablespoons and trying to just pick out the dried flowers, I gave up after realizing that the non-flower debris was about 1/3 of total.
2253	5	Yes it is a little "earthy" (not like dirt as another review) but I like it.  It's very refreshing, and works wells to take off excess water weight.  I do not know if it helps burn fat, but that's not why I drink it.  I drink it because it tastes good.
2254	5	I love both orignal and spicy flavored, great any time during day or night.  Fresh and warm a treat that is usually only available cold and with two flavor choices.
2255	5	I purchased the Kona to use with a small coffee maker to use on a trip to Las Vegas.  I purchased the Kona because my wife loves Kona as a result of a Hawaii vacation some years ago.  Coffee upsets her stomach and she usually has to cut her coffee with water then add 1/2 & 1/2 creamer.  She can drink this Kona black without adding anything and no stomach upset.  I'm back to buy more after our trip.  By all means, don't buy this stuff, I want to make sure there's some left the nexttime I check in.
2256	5	I have tried many different k-cups and this has remained my favorite for the longest time. It is the perfect balance, not too weak and not too bold. And since I usually drink my coffee black, the flavor alone is very important to me. It' has a great flavor and not too acidic.
2257	5	My toy poodle loves these treats to the extent that she will accept nothing else.
2258	5	Good Honey. Go for it. Not much else to say but I need a certain amount of words for the software to accept the review.
2259	5	This coffee will make you realize that Starbucks' coffee is total crap.  Hawaiian Kona Coffee is worth every penny, but beware that after drinking this, all other coffee will taste like ash in comparison.
2260	5	Always looking for a deal on K cups.. The prices are going up everytime we buy some.. These were a deal..Thanks..
2261	3	Sure disappointed with Amazon as they sent me a collection of Donut House coffee and not the Cinnamon Roll as I asked.  What is up with that?
2262	5	This is the best hot chocolate I've ever had.  It's all my family drinks.  I give packets to people all the time to try and they always LOVE it.  BUT you have to mix it with milk to get the full deliciousness.  I'm never without a stash of this hot chocolate.  I buy it in volume because we drink so much.
2263	5	I love this soup so much, that I used my gift cards to get it.  And for those of you on weight watcher's, it's only 1 delicious point. I like to eat it with a grilled cheese sandwich or good tasting crackers.  I love the taste and the fact that I don't have to feel guilty when I eat it.  Make sure to simmer it on the stove, verses the microwave. I think it taste's better simmered.
2264	5	Very good to use to add beef flavor to food. Have given this product to family and friends to introduce them to it.
2265	5	Quick delivery and excellent coffee.  I love strong coffee, and this fits the bill.  Would gladly buy again.
2266	5	This is some of the best old time candy on the market. It is sticky,but worth every bite. Wish the bags were larger,though.
2267	5	my grandson can't have milk, and i live in a rural area. i can't get powdered soymilk in the stores. i found this product worth it's weight. he loves it it. thank you very much.
2268	5	There is known design flaw having to do with the gasket on the upper needle. You can hear the screams about that by reading the reviews for the 'My Cup'. The gasket moves too much and as a result is does not seal correctly. Green Mountain seems to not want to fix it since it means selling less over-priced coffee, which is what these machines are designed to do.<br /><br />1. No matter what method I use, I have learned to carefully reach in and pull the little washer/gasket down as far as I can on the upper needle. This will ensure a better seal and avoid overflow.<br /><br />2. Just as importantly when I put the DisposaKup in, I press it down to make sure the lower needle has pierced the cup completely. This will make sure you have a flow of water that streams through the cup.<br /><br />3. Fill it up and then tap the cup on the counter to settle the coffee grinds into the cup, do not press the coffee down or pack it in.<br /><br />The key is take a couple extra seconds and these will work perfectly and you will save money. I love mine and will be ordering more once they are available again.
2269	5	We have used this seasoning for the last few years and regularly serve to guests when having Salmon.  Everyone comments on how good it is.  I was so disappointed when Costco stopped carrying it, so I had to order online!  You WON'T be disappointed. It is amazing and the larger container is the best deal!
2270	5	If you like Graham crackers and you like oats and honey then you will love this product.  Just the right amount of each makes this a real treat to eat.  I only wish it had less sodium (130 mg).  Apart from that the lack of trans fat and saturated fat makes this a healthy choice for graham cracker lovers.  I would buy this whole grain product again.
2271	5	At first, we did not get along.  It spit and spewed in our B60 and made me mad that I had paid full price for two of these new K-cup replacements.  Good coarse grind, check.  No grounds around lid before closing, check.  Not too full, check.  Seated properly in Keurig, check.<br />My best guess was that the lid was not sealing properly because there was a little wiggle room when closed, so I contacted the company by email and asked if a replacement seal would help.  I was delighted when they offered to send replacement Ekobrews.  The next morning, we tried something different.  We removed, cleaned and replaced the rubber piece that surrounds the needle that inserts into K-cups in the top of the machine.  That helped, a lot.  The next cup we decided to try turning the Ekobrew around so that the hinge was at the front of the machine.  Perfection!  I cannot explain why, but it worked.  I did let them know right away that replacements were not necessary, but they were already in the mail!<br />We now have an alternative to K-cups that makes a great tasting cup of coffee, can handle enough to brew a nice strong travel mug full and is easy to fill and clean.  We will continue buy K-cups when the price is right, but when it isn't we can still have great, single cup coffee without breaking the bank.<br />Just as a note, we tried the Solofill, which is a good product, but it just did not hold quite enough coffee for a happy mug.
2272	5	By far the best tasting gluten free cereal I have tried. Good cruch, taste.  Have tried others but this is one of the 2 that suscribe on Amazon for over an year.
2273	5	I have tried many K cups and some are hits and others are just plain misses. This one is a HIT! I don't like strong, bitter tasting coffee. This one has a smooth, mild taste that I love. I normally only drink one cup of coffee per day, but I have found myself craving this for an afternoon treat. I will definitely be purchasing this flavor again.
2274	5	I love these! These are soo good...even my toddler loves them. I always keep a few in the diaper bag for snacks on the go. I especially appreciate that they are gluten free. I myself am not gluten free, but my MIL is, and it is hard to keep healthy snacks (other than fruit) in the house that are gluten free. The Cherry Pie flavor is our favorite!
2275	5	OK.  Best cookie ever.  The only reason to live on the East Coast.<br /><br />I've had people ship them to me in Denver (5000 ft).  They were all broken.  I believe these cookies are effectively airtight so they "pop" when brought to altitude.  Probably why they'll never be on the store shelves in Denver.<br /><br />Still taste great, just have to eat them faster.  Still worthy of 5 stars.<br /><br />I ordered some from here, but haven't received them yet.  We'll see what happens.
2276	5	These things are very good with a beautiful lemon flavor. If you have kids, buy atleast 2 boxes, they were gone in 2 days.
2277	5	I would describe this outstanding coffee as strong, bold, dark, rich, and with a lot of character. There's nothing mild about it. It isn't your average, bland coffee. I recommend it.<br /><br />Edited to say that I have friends who find it wonderful, but they wouldn't describe it as I would, so strong it knocks your socks off! Maybe it depends on how much you drink of it.  :)
2278	5	Upon opening the can one becomes aware that this tuna IS DIFFERENT; different from ANY tuna on your typical grocery store shelf, that is. The tuna "meat" is MUCH cleaner with FAR less skin and other objectionable "stuff". I have purchased several cases of this tuna over the last couple of years and I will continue to do so; as long as it is available, anyway.
2279	5	I think my cats are addicted to these treats. If they are sleeping and they hear me holding the bag, they came running, if they are playing, they stop playing and come running. It doesnt matter what they are doing, these treats are their priority in life. I cannot run out from these treats, they dont even allow me to sleep if I dont give them some treats before going to bed. And these natural ones seem delicious!!
2280	5	I had this stuff when I was a kid living in Hong Kong.  Not made of artificial sweeteners or high fructose corn syrup.  It is a concentrated drink mix.<br /><br />Mix it at regular strength for that unique Black Current flavor or splash a little into some sparkling water.<br /><br />It is very refreshing with mint and ice.
2281	5	I first tasted this sauce when I was visiting in Alaska.  It was served with fish tacos, and was the perfect combination of sweet and spicy.  I couldn't find it locally, so I ordered it from Amazon.  It's available for a reasonable price, and is wonderful with fish, pork and chicken.  I haven't tried it on beef, but not sure if it would be good or not.  It's also terrific on vegetables.  I highly recommend this product!
2282	5	Yes, you read that correctly. Both cats refuse to eat unless they have a large heaping of Cat-Man-Doo. They will go on hunger strikes if this is not incorporated into their meals twice a day. Once I ran out and they both loss weight because they would not look at their dry food or even wet food. They also, consume less food if they have this placed as a side dish. Thank you!!! My babies are happy!
2283	5	I love that I can order this under the Subscribe & Save plan. It's WAY cheaper than buying it at the grocery store. And this is good coffee -- the Senseo is fabulous because I can limit how much coffee I drink by only making one cup at a time.
2284	5	Our 75 pound chocolate lab eats a lot of food - and this food is her favorite!  We started ordering on Amazon because none of our local stores carry this and it wasn't worth the gas to drive a couple hours to pick it up.  The dog gets excited when the box is delivered because she knows this food is in it!  She loves this food!  The size and the hole in the middle of the food make it so that the dog has to slow down a bit to chew it.  Our dog was never one to just inhale her food, but it does seem to make her eat slower.
2285	5	Like others said, if you like the ones that come out of the dispensers at the mini marts & gas stations then you should like this. I use the 10oz setting on my brewer so it doesn't water it down too much (it's a powdered mix like the hot chocolates). Also my wife is not a coffee drinker but liked this.<br /><br />Placed order when it was out of stock, but only took about week to arrive via prime.
2286	1	They advertise that they contain 'no aspartame in diet flavors' and boldly state 'no high fructose corn syrup', but the regular flavors contain sucralose artificial sweetners making it taste awful. No disclaimer on the front of the bottle. How can they legally NOT call it DIET if it has artificial sweetners? Anyway, unless you like and can drink diet drinks you will not like 'regular' flavors either.
2287	4	These are great for a candy dispenser I have at work.  Some of the other versions of M&M's are too large to process through the machine without breaking them into pieces.  On the flip side, current pricing on Amazon seem to be almost double what you can get them for in the store.  Walmart sells these for $2.98 a bag...you do the math.
2288	5	Love the flavor!  Not too strong, but not weak - just right.  My favorite morning drink!  I do not have to add any sugar, cream , or milk.  It is perfect the way it comes.
2289	5	we bought these for someone who loves hot sauces, and he said they truly are very hot!  plus, with the packaging, it just makes for a fun gift.
2290	4	This is a pretty good all around tea.  You can make this pretty strong very easily.  Nothing too special about.  I will probably go on to try other teas.
2291	4	This is in my top five favorite K-cups. While it does taste more like hot chocolate, I brew one of these and then immediately brew the Donut Shop bold in the same cup. Mix the two together and THAT tastes like a real mocha. I still buy these again and again.
2292	3	The product is great, HOWEVER the shipping was outlandish not a good buy, unless u live in a remote location with NO stores, then the shipping would be worse.BAD IDEA TO BUY THIS!
2293	3	I ate a pack of these last week and since I like the taste of honey they did taste pretty good to me - well actually I have to confess that I ate the whole pack in one sitting...see I had the munchies and these were the only thing I had in reach.  Actually, after I ate the whole pack I was still hungry.  Each piece is really about the size of a Starburst candy so my personal vibe was that eating a few tiny squares wouldn't be giving me any extra energy on top of all the other coffees, (diet) red bulls, and cliff bars I frequently consume.<br /><br />  They did taste pretty natural and I could taste the honey.  I might eat them again for a sweet tooth fix but at $1+ per pack and non-filling I'll probably stick to cliff bars and just secretly raid my office neighbor's starburst jar for a sweet tooth fix here and there.  Overall I give 3 stars out of 5 in consideration of price/value and other alternatives out there.
2294	4	This is a very good chilli mix for Cincinnati style chilli.  It reminds me of the great chilli parlors when I lived there. Yummy! Recommend you serve it over spaghetti, topped with kidney beans, green onions and sharp cheddar cheese.
2295	5	I picked up a bottle of Sudden Death and Beyond Death.  I have previously had After Death, which is very similar, except half as hot.  After Death is the best in terms of pure taste.  Sudden Death is almost as good but twice as hot.  I didn't really care for Beyond Death which is just as hot as Sudden Death, but had both a sweet and a sour flavor at the time time that didn't sit well with me.<br /><br />To date, I have mixed this sauce in with ketchup on a burger, and with BBQ sauce on chicken drumsticks.  I was able to use a good amount of it without finding it overly hot, but my threshold for heat is a lot higher than most people.
2296	5	These things are great! I know which of my cats don't like fishy flavors and which prefer them so we bought both flavors.  MUCH more reasonable from Amazon than at pet specialty stores, even the big ones.  If I know a pill has a really bad taste, I'll break the tab and the Pocket so the cat won't even try to chew them.  I hope we don't have to use them often...I hope my cats stay healthy...but having these around sure makes pilling a lot easier.  We love them!  They came quickly in the mail and were well-packed.  Successful all the way around.
2297	5	This is getting harder to find and it's a pity. It is my absolute favorite soda.  Just sweet enough, without being too sweet, with a lovely vanilla-like aftertaste.
2298	5	The texture and flavor is wonderful!<br />This is great with salsa or other dips - or just by themselves.<br />Lower in sodium than the average tortilla chip and gluten free.  Amazon's bulk price is the best! :)
2299	5	We bought a Breadman TR2200C Ultimate Bread Machine about five years ago.  We discovered Hodgson Mill 9 Grain Bread Mix, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001G6V8S">Hodgson Mill, Bread Mix Nine Grain, 16-Ounce</a>, at the HEB supermarkets when we lived in the Austin, TX, area, and found them at Sweetbay and Publix here in Florida when we moved her three years ago.  For some reason both stores quit carrying this item, so we were delighted to find that Amazon carries it at a very reasonable price <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FDDESM">Hodgson Mill 9 Grain Bread Mix, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.<br /><br />My wife adds dried cranberries, coconut flakes and walnut pieces to this mix and it makes a delightful bread, comparable to artisan loaves selling for $5 or more.
2300	5	I have had to be gluten free for the last 3 years.  I tried many different brands of pasta, with disappointing results.  Bionaturae is far superior to all the rest.  If you didn't know it was gluten free you would think it was made with flour.  It''s very good.
2301	5	These pretzels are extremely good tasting.  Very difficult to tell the difference compared to pretzels with gluten.
2302	3	These bars are not a great on-the-go alternative to granola bars because their chocolate coating make them very messy. They come two to a package, which makes for easy sharing between two siblings. My kids like the taste fine.
2303	2	This is the first time I've ordered Miso soup and will be the last time.  I did not like the flavor and ended up giving the balance of what I purchsed to a soup kitchen.  Hope their clients liked it better than I did.
2304	5	If you're looking for absolutely the best distilled spirit you can buy for the money (an issue that used to come up every Friday night in my younger days) you simply cannot do better than Elijah Craig 12.  It's an under-appreciated classic of American bourbon crafting.  You simply cannot buy a distilled spirit of any kind from any country remotely close to this refinement and quality for anywhere close to the bargain basement low price of Elijah Craig 12.  It's a stone. cold. bargain.  Have I said that enough?<br /><br />In the glass it's dark burnished bronze with a molten luminescent core: beautiful and rich.  The aroma blooms with lots of time, like a good whiskey should: corn on the cob, black fruits (prune / fig) sawn oak, and old tanned leather.  First sip and I'm amazed at how dry and sophisticated this is for bourbon.  There's burnt caramel and corn fruitiness - but muted below the rich oak tannins and wood resin.  You can taste the years this whiskey has laid in the rich wood.  Mid palate has big red fruit notes married to the wood, a sophisticated sherry-like presentation.  Finish is long and complex with faint drifts of sandalwood and distant smoke weaving in among the buttered corn, hot spirit, sherry and tanned leather.  The dark fudgy edge curbing the fruit sweetness reminds me of bitter orange or very dark chocolate.  This is a top flight bourbon flavor extravaganza that feels lean and sinewy while at the same time as it manages to be sweet and rich.  The red fruit speaks of sunlight and sugar while the dark wood and bitter notes speak of age and darkness.  This is excellent depth of flavor and character.<br /><br />This bourbon would be impressive regardless of price.  At this price (the same as any ordinary mass market bottle of hooch) it's astounding.  This bourbon is of a piece with fine single malts or vsop/xo cognac.  Sip it slow and neat in a small glass.  I pray they never come to their senses.
2305	5	Love being able to receive a large fresh quantity of the Good n Plenty candies.  They are wonderful to share.  They stay fresh and tasty for a nice amount of time!
2306	4	I generally drink this in the late evening as it is decaf. The taste is nice and enjoyable. Not as dark and bold as I normally prefer, but does a good job for an evening decaf coffee.
2307	5	We love this canned salmon. Delish. Low in sodium. Very fresh tasting, considering it's from a can. And of course, it cannot be compared to wild caught fresh salmon. But it's a tasty alternative to the ubiquitous tuna fish.<br /><br />Even better, I can't find this brand and packaging in my local stores. So ordering this from Amazon is a major hoot.
2308	3	I think this snack is okay, it healthy and not too sweet.<br />But my kids (1, 3, and 7) don't like it.  I thought they would since they usually like any kind of dried fruit snack but for some reason this just wasn't a big hit at our home.<br />I might try their other flavors to see if those are more popular with the kids :)
2309	5	great price for this product. It usually runs `$10 a piece and I basically bought 2 and got the 3rd free. This is a great product to get a widower or elderly person as a gift.
2310	5	My daughter loved this cotton candy. It was hard to find in the stores but am glad we found it online.
2311	4	Check your local grocery stores,  mine: (MARKET BASKET / STAR MKT.) has 'em for as low as 2 for  $3 on sale<br />thats way less than half this on line price!<br />& If not have your grocery manager order some for you,<br />No reason to pay double for these.<br />a good product indeed though!
2312	5	So, there is a bit of confusion here about the ingredients in this product. Upon speaking with The Good Earth directly, I have learned that the 18-count Original Sweet & Spicy Tea (both caffeine-free and regular) have artificial flavor, whereas the 25-count boxes do not. It seems like a stupid way to differentiate, since the boxes look exactly the same, with the same exact name. I think they do this so as not to highlight the fact that any of their products have artificial flavoring. I learned from them that they originally had artificial flavor in the blend, then removed it, and received complaints because it tasted different (though probably only slightly). They then added it back to their formula, but only in the 18-count boxes. It is a "spice flavor not found in nature," they claim, so I guess there's no other way to please the people who like that flavor. The first box I got was from an outlet grocery store that was produced during the in-between period when the artificial flavor had been removed from all boxes. It was really good just like that; I still enjoyed the flavor of the new version (technically the old version) that I received from Amazon, but actually not quite as much, and I'd rather have the natural version since it's natural and I like that one anyway.<br /><br /> As a note about the flavor--I really like this tea. It is, as described, sweet and spicy. It has a very cinnamon-y flavor with a lot of dimension added by all the other flavors included. I drink a few cups a day, either caffeinated or the rooibos version, depending on time of day. The flavor between these two are slightly different, but comparable. I love the fact that it is delicious without sugar and/or milk (though also delicious with either or both as well)--this is coming from someone with a serious sweet tooth. So that helps a lot, but apparently it has 3 calories per serving.<br /><br />If you like this, you may also enjoy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E63LDS">Celestial Seasonings Herb Tea, Bengal Spice, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>--another spicy herbal tisane that I like without sugar. Hope this helps!
2313	5	I love this flavor oatmeal. It reminds me of the strawberry shortcake popsicles I used to eat. It has just the right amount of sweetness to where you don't need to add anything to it, it's good on it's own. Definitely recommend.
2314	5	i love this cookies so does my family bought more this week when we went to the store i plan to keep this all the time they are a great snack
2315	4	I am not a big fan of sugared drinks and I always try to consume sugar free liquids. Red bull regular is a taste I do not like so I take the sugar free kind. This is better to mix with vodka too since you don't need more sugar with alcohol.
2316	5	I have personally been on a mission to find my favorite jerky for a few years now.  This is by far my favorite jerky - just a little spicy, great texture, perfect size for a snack, and pretty healthy besides sodium.
2317	4	Buffalo Bills 8oz Spicy Beef Jerky<br /><br />I ordered Buffalo Bills 8oz of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IA3S1Y">Buffalo Bills 8oz Teriyaki Country Cut Beef Jerky Pack</a>and got a free sample of Buffalo Bills 8oz Spicy Beef Jerky with it.<br /><br /> If you like jerky it doesn't get much better than this; at least I haven't eaten it.  I prefer the Teriyaki and the Bar-B-que to the Spicy, but it is all good.<br /><br />I recommend this product.  Since I'm a diabetic I should say it has 2 grams of carbohydrates per 1 ounce of product.  I eat it as a dessert, about 1 ounce at a time.<br /><br />Gunner  March, 2010
2318	1	One star for the taste. I like wasabi and it is good to find a seaweed with wasabi taste. However, the fourth bag I took out from the box was OPENED!! It seems that someone opened it and put it back into the box. Horrible experience!
2319	5	Quick shipment. I use these to garnish stir fry and hot dishes. Also munchies. Price seems comparable to Ware House Club deal (Sams)..
2320	1	I ordered this gift package on extreme sale, and I still don't feel it was good value.  Many items were omitted or replaced -- I don't have it in front of me, but I don't believe I got the skeleton gummies, cotton candy, pretzels, or caramel corn.  No name-brand candies ("Tootsie rolls, Hershey bars, Skittles, M & M's and more!") were included; this was replaced by a bag of Breyers chocolates (a dollar at any drugstore).  "Pumpkin shortbread" and "pumpkin chocolate" cookies were pumpkin-shaped, but not pumpkin-flavored.  The coloring set and pumpkin-carving sets were dollar-store quality.<br /><br />The box was packed securely in Amazon's shipping box, but the bottom of the cute box was broken out and wouldn't pop back, so the contents slip out.  Unfortunate, since it's a nice design.<br /><br />I'm very glad it was shipped to me and not directly to the gift recipient.  I would have been embarrassed and I would never have known how much wasn't included.  You could easily make a better version of this gift box for under $10 at a dollar store.
2321	5	I love this tea! I used to have such bad periods that I was bent over screaming, throwing up and crying so hard. No medication could help me calm down at all. I got this tea and started drinking it the day I got my period and within 3 to 10 sips I had no more cramps at all. Now I drink it 10-5 days before a period and I have no more cramps, no more screaming and crying or anything. I LOVE this tea! It is a gift to all females who have bad menstrual cycles! I want to start drinking it when I do get pregnant and try to have a natural birth.
2322	5	I love the Salba and hidden veggie.  It is easy to eat and a much better flavor than the other pouches that are on the market.  HappyBaby pouches are by far the best out there
2323	5	Almonds are one of the most healthy, satisfying foods you can find.  These are nice and spicy with the right snack size.  I debated getting these or the big tins, but the small bags helps me control the overeating and mindless snack munching.
2324	5	I don't always like flavored coffees, but this had a good vanilla flavor, with or without milk.  I like the k-cup system, does a nice job when you want just a single cup.
2325	5	My husband loves this tea.  He drinks it for the antioxidant contents.<br />We had difficulty finding it in any of our favorite grocery stores.<br />Now, we simply order from Amazon.
2326	5	As a tea drinker, I did not think Carmel sounded like one I would like.  Boy, was I wrong.  This tea is fabulous and addicting.  What I love about all of Dilmahs teas is that you first taste the tea and then the flavor used.  I do also like that it is all natural flavoring.  Dilmah Carmel makes you feel like you have just had a nice treat with none of the guilt.  I will make sure my cabinet is stocked with this one.
2327	5	We rarely drink sodas in my family, but when we do crave some, we drink Switch now! It tastes wonderful(all the varieties are delicious) and all the ingredients are safe for you, no extra sugar or any other kind of junk in it!
2328	3	Open the package expecting instructions or advice on use, nothing! Injected large amount in several spots should have injected small amount in a bunch of places!Had dry creole seasoning what do you do with it? mix it in the liquid to increase heat, sprinkle on bird before of after deep frying? If you don't inject it all through out the bird you get areas over seasoned while others need help. And I still have no idea what to do with the dry!
2329	5	Can't beat Amazon prices!  They treats are GREAT for training!  Small and great to keep in a little tote while you are training your puppies.  Small enough that I can give them a bunch.<br /><br />My only complaint is that they STINK!  But, I guess that's why the dogs love them!<br /><br />Would highly recommend!
2330	5	Nice to know my 15 year old cat is eating healthy organic food (and has done for years) AND that he loves the taste!
2331	1	Our dog didnt even go near this, it was like she would pee everywhere EXCEPT where the pee post was. I even tried moving the dog poop near it.....still didnt work. I just wasted my money. I've just come to the conclusion that dogs go to the bathroom wherever they want. Im done trying to change that, its to stressful!
2332	5	I am so excited to see that Amazon sells the Starbucks VIA Iced Coffee! I never thought to look before now, and have been ordering it direct from Starbucks and paying their exorbitant shipping charges. I sucked it up because I have to have this coffee. I am not a fan of hot coffee, but I am an iced coffee junkie. I have been known to double fist the 32 oz iced coffees from McDonald's, I am that ridiculous.<br /><br />When the Starbucks Via Iced Coffee came out late last year, I couldn't wait to try it.  I first drank it just with cold water and ice.  It is already sweetened, so we are good to go there.  I missed my sweet, milky iced coffee from McDonald's, so I had to experiment a little bit.  I tried adding a little skim milk.  That helped, it tasted even better.<br /><br />Then I bought a gallon of 2% chocolate milk, and put a bit of that in instead of the regular milk. Oh my gosh! I have a better tasting iced coffee (in my opinion) than I can buy at any cafe.  It is so delicious, and I look forward to it every morning.  I think this VIA is made to be mixed with milk, it is strong so that the rich coffee flavor shines through even with milk mixed in.  When I run out of chocolate milk, I use skim milk with a good squeeze of Nestle Quick syrup, a good alternative.<br /><br />I have been trying to find a good iced coffee to make at home for several years, and this is it...I was brewing whole pots of hot coffee and trying to add ice and vanilla syrup, and coffee creamer...bleh, it was so much work and tasted half as good as this!  Give the VIA a try, you won't be disappointed!
2333	5	After slowly transitioning to this food over the period of a week, I did notice some looser stools just as many other people reviewing this product.  Towards the end of this transition time the stools became normal and it is a dogfood that he loves to eat.  I can't say that the "lifebits" that are in the mix is his favorite thing to eat, but most of the time his bowl is clean.  If he leaves anything in his bowl, it would be a few (2-3) of those which is a very small percentage of what was in the bowl to begin with.<br /><br />My dog IS a PICKY eater and with other brands I have often had to add a small treat to his bowl in order for him to eat it all, but I do not have that issue with this brand.  The one thing that I have done is to add some warm water to the bits which makes them softer as well as release the aroma and flavor.  My dog reacts the same way as he would have if I put some gravy on top of his food when I do that.<br /><br />He has gone from walking up to his bowl and looking at me wondering where his "treat" is so that he can eat to jumping up on his hind legs, bouncing around excited that he is about to be fed.<br /><br />The only downside I can think of with this product is that just like some other posters pointed out, there was evidence of some loose stool during transition and that the lifebits does not seem to be something that he enjoys eating.
2334	5	These bags are easy to use and I have them attatched to my dog's leash for easy access.  They arrived quickly, were sold at a good price and are exactly as promised.  The fact that they have a  plesant although mild scent makes my multi-mile walks much more enjoyable!  The fact that they're biodegradable a huge added bonus!  I will order again and again.
2335	5	I bought this at a food booth that was set up at a crafts show. The jar sat on my kitchen shelf unopened for a good year. Finally, I decided to try it on a pan fried skirt steak. I had NEVER made such a tasty steak at home in my life. It was incredible. Just like a fancy steak house. You just have to try this stuff to believe it. Its like magic. When I ran out, I went online and ordered the $29 giant jar and I now stockpile it in my freezer. Everyone who tastes this goes WHOA what did you do to this steak?
2336	5	My dog just needs to see me shake the container of these treats, and she comes running to sit at my feet. She'll circle through all the tricks she knows in order to get one! They are a good small size, so I don't feel bad about giving them to her and ruining her appetite for her regular meals.
2337	5	As other reviews state, Aranciata is great after a relatively oily Italian meal. The picture that Amazon shows is not correct - it's actually in the blue and orange can, with a foil lid on top. The foil lid is nice if you are paranoid about germs on aluminum cans. I haven't found the cans in grocery stores near to me, and having it delivered is both cheaper and easier than buying from the local deli.
2338	4	We have been using this product for years.  Walmart stopped carrying it and the other local supermarkets are unreliable about stocking it.
2339	5	OMG!  This is the best granola ever.  I love carrot cake but rarely indulge because of high fat, high calorie content.  This stuff really is the next best thing to eating a slice of carrot cake.<br />I mixed it up with some plain Fago yogurt for an incredibly delicious and filling breakfast.  Now I just need to keep my family away from eating all of it as a snack.<br />Decided to buy it with subscribe and save just so we don't run out.<br />Am looking forward to trying some of the other flavors but will likely buy a single bag at my local co-op prior to committing to 6 bags at once.
2340	5	<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5QW6">Total Raisin Bran Cereal, 18.25-Ounce Box (Pack of 6)</a><br />Total taste great. Is great for health. And is great.
2341	5	This pasta stays al dente much more than other brands I have tried.  I am so impressed that I am going to make a point of looking for this particular brand from now on.  Bulk shopping clubs sell this for $7 per 9 boxes.
2342	5	Just returned from Ireland and had this tea often there.  I was so happy to find that Amazon had a resource for me to get it, too.  Great tasting tea!
2343	5	In simple words the best so far! Fast delivery ....can't go wrong. Nothing to envy other brands. Def. will buy more. Happy.
2344	2	I was so excited to find Shade Grown, Fair Trade, Organic, Decaf coffee.  But it's not good.  It just tastes bad, that is the only way to put it.  Coffee should have a certain flavor, even cheap diner coffee tastes like coffee, but this coffee not so much.  It's definitely a light roast, and maybe I put too much in the pot when I made it, but both my husband and I right off the bat said this taste is gross.  I love Paul Newman's Organic coffee, but while I love the message and even the name of Tiny Footprint, I don't think I'll buy it again.  Now what to do with 2 pounds of coffee I can't stand to drink?
2345	5	This stuff is nothing short of amazing. I love it and my only grief is that they don't seem to sell it outside of the US, so I have to have folks bring it to me when they come with them on the airplane. I use it as a face moisturizer, to cook, bake, as a hair mask and soon I will be using it as nipple cream for breastfeeding and as baby bum cream. It's the one product I can't live without. The price for the size is a great bargain, because I can pay this much in the health food store for a much smaller size jar. Thank you Amazon.
2346	4	If you try this product , you wont be disappointed.  It is a nice formula that I have never come accross before.  If you are interested in good health then its worth a try.  It is priced middle of the road and has a fresh smell to it, with no after taste or burping problems.
2347	1	I've loved using NuStevia for 5 years.<br /><br />I tried using this stevia instead.  It's won't dissolve in HOT coffe.<br /><br />It takes 9 packets of this brand instead of 2 packets of other brands.<br /><br />Customer service refuses to pay for me to ship this back to them.<br /><br />Do not waste your money on this diluted, non-disolving stevia.  It's cheaper to buy a more concentrated brand that will disolve in coffee.
2348	4	Theses are great noodle alternatives. No smell or taste once rinsed in a strainer for a couple minutes.<br /><br />I gave it four stars because 15 bucks for 6 single person portions is expensive
2349	1	I purchased a pack of 6 boxes of 33.8 ounce Vita Coco coconut water.  The package arrived fine.  I put 3 boxes in my refrigerator.  Boy, did they make a mess!  All 3 started leaking overnight.  My wife was not happy at all. I transferred the leaking packs to soda bottles.  I don't want to try putting the remaining 3 packs in the refrigerator and will transfer to soda bottles as well.  I wish I could get a refund, but there is no way to return now, and no easy way to contact the vendor.  This turned out to be a real pain!
2350	5	I grew up in SC and chicken and dumplings are a weekly meal for us.  I found these at a Piggly Wiggly grocery store and have been buying them ever since.  They are the best dumplings on the market.  Way better than the frozen ones.  We recently moved to Alaska with the military and I was devastated to not be able to buy these anymore.  Then I saw on the McLib's website that they are available on amazon now.  I am so exctied!  I will be ordering tons of these!
2351	5	Stonewall Kitchen's Mango Chutney is terrific. Chutney is a very under valued condiment in our American cuisine, too bad for those who don't use it to enhance even the simpliest of meals. This particular Mango Chutney is excellent and goes well on anything from a complex curry dish to a veggie-burger.
2352	1	I found the soup a bit too gritty and the flavor was not my cup of tea. It was a bit too smoke flavored for my taste also. My brother seems to like it so I would conclude "different strokes for different folks".
2353	5	I bought several items from Barry Farms, all of which were very fairly priced and arrived promptly.  It is not always easy to find pumpkin seeds that are shelled, ready to consume. Pumpkin seeds are chewier than sunflower kernels and can be tough or stale, but Barry's are crisp-chewy.  Because I snack on them and toss them in the nightly salad, I haven't added them to homemade crackers, breads and muffins as planned, but I think they'll be ideal for those projects when I order more.
2354	5	I like cinnamon candies. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00503KIJ0">Hot Tamales Giant Bag (4.5 pounds)</a>  were my favorite, but to preserve my teeth I needed a non-chewy candy. Newman's Own are great. The tiny little mints come in a nice reusable tin, the flavor is just right, not sweet and cinnamonny enough. I love the convenience of  Amazon. I find what I need, my Prime membership ensures quick & free shipping on almost everything.
2355	5	I was really worried about buying flowers from Falcon Farms as most customer reviews were either 5 star or 1 star without almost any in the middle.  So I had assumed that customer reviews were terrible but that maybe the manufacturer posted great reviews to counteract the bad ones.  It's hard to tell.<br /><br />Well, according to my sister-in-law the flowers look great and they arrived within two days of ordering them.
2356	5	When you offer it to someone, they might freak on the name.  But it has a great taste.  One of my favorites.
2357	3	Tasted my first 8 ounce cup with the usual amount of sugar. It's fair I guess for a medeum roast coffee but homestly I've had better & I won't be buying any after my 15 count pack runs out. Sorry this one's not a winner as the caffiene is on the weak side however the flavor seems to be good. Unless your not looking for that morning coffee wakeup then I'd pass on this one.
2358	5	I add walnuts and chocolate chunks to this mix and no one can tell they are Gluten Free. I have been asked for the recipe. I do suggest kneading the dough in the bowl as it makes the cookies less grainy. Buy it by the 6 pack as it is much less expensive that way.
2359	5	The Swiss Colony 14 Country Favorites Was better than advertised! especially the Ham which was delicious and a good value.
2360	3	<span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:59 Mins<br /><br /></span>What better way to review a dog biscuit than to show how much a dog enjoyed eating it? That was my logic behind this very amateurish but heartfelt video review starring my 1 1/2-year-old Shih Tzu, Missy.<br /><br />The video was very impromptu and, in hindsight, I realize that I didn't do a great job of explaining why I only gave the product 3 stars, so I'm adding some further explanation here.<br /><br />First, I took a star off because I felt that if you're going to make a multi-sized dog biscuit, the small should be small enough for the very small breeds like Yorkies and Chihuahuas.  As you can see in the video, this small biscuit is not only 2 inches long and quite thick but VERY hard, so I feel like a very small or more delicate breed may have trouble with even the small biscuit.<br /><br />Second, the ingredient list on the box is almost 3 inches long.  Sugar and salt are within the first 10 ingredients and, while there are a lot of vitamins and minerals included, there is also partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, several food colorings and chemicals I can hardly pronounce.  I just prefer to feed Missy more natural foods and snacks.<br /><br />Third, the "feeding instructions" (which hardly seemed necessary) direct me to give Missy 2 biscuits twice a day.  That's 4 large (compared to the small Mother Hubbard bone-shaped treats she usually gets) treats a day, which seemed a bit much, especially much considering my issues with the ingredient list.
2361	3	My son loves these things, but they go too fast. He pretty much eats half a bag at a time - and that ends up being quite expensive. I stopped buying them because of this. However, I would definitely consider getting them again for a roadtrip because they are dry, portable, and not messy even if dropped on the floor or seat. But for snacks at home, they are not worth the money.
2362	3	The first one you eat tastes pretty good. But I got tired of them pretty quickly. Too gooey and sugary. And probably very bad for teeth. I prefer Lara Bars.
2363	5	"These were very good. Bought three 36 count boxes and only two pieces were a little bit hard on the top layer of the petite four. Would not hesitate to buy again, very, very good."
2364	5	Makes my life easier to please everyone with the choice of hard and soft tacos.  This online shopping is great, with Amazon offering $10 off for every $49!  I'm sure the UPS guy is tired of delivering all these groceries, but this taco dinner kit makes life easier for on the go people who want a good meal that will please everyone and is quick to make!
2365	5	This granola cereal is DELICIOUS!!!  Not only is it tasty, it's also pretty healthy.  It's relatively low in sugar and low in calories compared to other granolas.  I eat it with non-fat greek yogurt for a healthy breakfast or afternoon snack.
2366	1	This stuff is gross.  I have never tasted a product substitute that is soo far from the real thing.  The texture was gross, the flavor was gross, the smell is gross.  We passed it around work to see the reactions of all our co-workers when they tasted it.  Nobody liked it, it was so funny seeing the reactions when they tasted it.  It is great for a good laugh.  seriously this stuff is bad.
2367	4	I normally purchase this tea in Toronto Canada and I love it.  I was glad to find it on amazon.  For some reason it does taste a little different to me but I'll know for sure when I get my next Toronto purchase.  Unfortunately it was a long break before I found and purchased this one from Amazon.  Overall a great and totally under-rated tea.
2368	5	I've bought many packs of various types of the Crunchies brand dried fruit and they are all excelent in my oppinion. This type of Crunchies is quite 'crunchy' and I like to sprinkle these on my brakefast cereal in the mornings. Plan to buy more of these delicious Crunchies brand snacks in the future!
2369	5	Got these on a recommendation from a friend.<br /><br />They are a fantastic healthy snack, very high in protein.  They definately have a kick, so if you don't like spicy you might want to pass.  But great to munch on if you are trying to kick the habit of potato chips.
2370	5	I was intrigued how this particular blend got such an exotic name, and I wasn't disappointed.  There is an ever so slight coconut aftertaste that makes this so delicious,  I don't like strong coffee, and this is perfect for my husband and I.  I get it send regularly now and it's one of our favorites!  Second only to Jamaica Me Crazy by Wolfgang Puck.  Wolfgang is much tastier than the other brands.
2371	5	I love this mix. It makes one batch (12 muffins) of fabulous 100-calorie blueberry muffins. The picture on the front of the mix is somewhat misleading, because you DO have to add blueberries (although it does say on the back that you need to add the blueberries yourself). The directions are a snap, and I personally really like the result. The muffins are very high in fiber so I tend to feel stuffed after just three muffins, and don't go on to eat four or five of them. Although if you are so inclined, that's still not too bad at 100 calories per muffin. There are other recipes for the mix at the Vitalicious site.
2372	5	I  gave this a try just to get Amazon's prime shipping when I  was trying to fill up a order. I  must admit that I'm glad I brought these even though when you add up the weight of each bag and price you can get about six big bags at Walmart , had just reorder some more because  I like the individual bags they was fresh and not smashed up in the box. Will probably order some more later.If up to me they should have equal amount of each variety will be worth it.
2373	5	*****<br />This is a peanut butter you can feel truly good about eating AND about giving to your children. Look up "palm fruit oil" on the Internet...google it...it is extremely healthy...the base of this peanut butter. Note that there IS added sugar, but it is relatively little.<br /><br />I normally eat unsweetened peanut butter as well as other nut butters and find this lightly sweetened peanut butter a fantastic treat. Put a little of this on a whole grain cracker and you'll be in heaven! In my case, it satisfies my sweet tooth and I don't want more--say a rich dessert--and so I am thrilled to tolerate the slight amount of sugar for the huge amount of benefit.<br /><br />No matter if you are a commercial peanut butter consumer or a purist who loves unsweetened raw nut butters--you will find much to love here--ESPECIALLY after you research all of the benefits of palm fruit oil. My husband is a junk food and fast food man and he also loves this...<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****
2374	1	This product is a disappointment. There was more of a candy coating than sunflower seed and the candy was not tasty at all. It had a stale and smoky quality to it that I did not expect and I could not find one person that tried them who liked the taste at all. The best part of these, unfortunately, is their look and vibrant colors - that's about it.
2375	5	These crackers are like eating oatmeal.  They can seem be a little dry at first compared to other crackers, but they're to be chewed well.  It's not like eating an airy cracker, it's like actually eating something solid.  My 2 year-old granddaughter loves them as well, it's a healthy snack for her!
2376	2	Heads up to all of you out there who love Mrs. Mays.  I too love their products and was a regular customer. I liked the simplicity of ingredients, the fact that most of them were "organic" and that they were Vegan. I purchased a case of various items from them directly, and imagine my surprise when I noticed the box they arrived in said "A Product of China." I emailed them and they confirmed that their product is indeed produced in China. Having traveled in China, and, based on recent problems related to products made in China, I am no longer buying Mrs. Mays. How anyrhinf grown there could be described as "organic" strikes me as disingenous at best. The energy required to ship the product back to the US also strikes me as wasteful. I no longer purchase their product. When they produce their products with locally grown, organic ingredients, I'll be back!
2377	5	Nostalgia has me reaching for the Jiffy Corn Muffin Mix - my grandmother used it in a ton of recipes growing up. I was happy to find the warehouse deals of this mix when re-creating a recipe a month or so ago. Now I'm glad I have the extra boxes to make more!
2378	4	The best hazelnut coffee you can buy for a Keurig, but Amazon is charging (currently) almost $40 for 2 23-pod boxes; the price should by at least $15 below that. If you see this coffee here for $25 or less for a 48-count shipment, get it!
2379	1	Be very aware that the new formula ALS is not agreeing with a lot of dogs.  I have one of these dogs and no amount of transitioning improved the diarrhea, vomiting, and hot spots.  There are many, many complaints on the web by people with dogs having the same symptoms that finally stopped upon changing to another food.  Canidae made major changes to their ALS formulas and did nothing to alert the public until they had to (their web site only).  There is still nothing on the bags to make people aware of the changes except a new ingredient list.  Do your homework before buying this dog food.  Dog owners across the country have spent lots of money unnecessarily at the vets trying to find answers to their dogs medical problems only to find that it's the food they've been feeding.  Used to be an outstanding product!  Wish I could give zero stars!
2380	1	We LOVE freeze dried fruits and vegetables in our house as snacks.  My kids eat freeze dried peas, corn, apples, pears, mango, and pineapple from several other companies, so when these were on sale, I thought I was getting a deal for small lunch box sized snacks.  I bought apples, pears, peaches, and pineapples.  The apples and pears leave something to be desired in terms of flavor in my opinion, but my kids like them well enough, so I won't complain.  The peaches and pineapples, however, are AWFUL!!!  The peaches taste stale despite not being expired and the pineapple consists of tasteless little slivers of fruit and fruit dust.  There are no chunks like the other brands we buy, and the flavor tastes more like cardboard than any recognizable fruit.  The kids won't eat them, nor will I, and Brother won't take them back unless I pay the return shipping, which winds up being half of what they cost, so we're stuck with dozens of bags of awful fruit.  Maybe I'll feed it to the birds and squirrels in the spring!<br /><br />Save your money and buy Sensible Foods or Just brand freeze-dried fruits and vegetables instead.
2381	5	My local store used to carry these soup bowls, but not any more.  Very happy to find they can be ordered from Amazon.<br />If you like hot and spicy foods, you'll like this.  Easy to prepare, filling and inexpensive.  Not the healthiest choice you can make, but very tasty.
2382	5	I have become addicted to this coffee. I had given up drinking coffe cause it made me sick, I tried many differents kinds of coffee, but my son bought this for me and I now drink a couple cups a day. It's so smooth. The only thing wrong is its so expensive, I know the proceeds go to Paul Newmans charity but still it's a bit pricey.
2383	5	I am always ordering these snacks. They are totally fruit that is freeze dried. There is no other added ingredient. I used to purchase these at Wal-mart and then they quit getting them. So thankful  for Amazon.
2384	5	This is the best gluten free, wheat free bread we have found.  Easy to make in bread machine.
2385	5	I eat this cereal almost everyday! It is the perfect combination of chocolate and peanut butter with a great crunch to it, who would not want that?
2386	5	This is really good popcorn.  It pops up nice and fluffy, and has much more of a "taste" to it than the store brand white popcorn I was using.
2387	5	<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009YXVJ4">Minus 8 Ice Wine Vinegar - 200 ml</a><br /><br />Best gourmet vinegar around
2388	5	Buying this multi-pack I was misled by the picture with whole hazel nuts. (Another proof how important is to read). But no problem. The chocolate is delicious like any Lindt's chocolate.
2389	3	I thought these would sparkle a lot more. I sprinkled them on frosting but you could barely tell they were there. I guess I can only use them on white frosting to get the best result. Next time I will get edible glitter instead or disco dust.
2390	5	Can't stand the other artificial sweetners, ack!  No issues with the seller, prompt and a good deal. Thank you!!
2391	5	This product is just what my chrildren and their friends wanted. I can assure you that it won't last long. I'm sure that I will be ordering again.
2392	5	This is great to have around for visitors who drink caffeinated coffee. Keep it in the fridge and you're always ready to serve a good cup of caffeine....one by one.
2393	5	When I opened the pouch I was excited because the smell was so amazingly good. I was preparing myself to be let down just in case because I figured this would be a difficult one to get right. I mean I really don't know when I can stop doubting Red Leaf Tea lol they have never let me down to date, so why would they now right? But still, I had to be cautious as I prepared my bowl of yumminess not to get my heart broken for the first time.<br /><br />As I am typing this I look sadly at my glass, as it is not half full or even half empty but it is totally empty and I am beginning to eat the remaining ice because there is still a little remnants of matcha hanging onto the cubes. If I could get my tongue down into the tall glass I would lick the inside of it!<br /><br />Having made my typical matcha latte, cold, with ice, creamer, milk, and the matcha mix I  think I gulped it down in a matter of minutes, and I am being generous, it was probably more like a manner of seconds! Its a wonder I even can recall what it tasted like as it blasted past my taste buds so quickly!<br /><br />It was in fact nutty, buttery, caramlish but with the toffee flavor of correctly burnt sugar flavor, and of course just the right amount of chocolate but not so much to mask the other wonderful flavors! And as always the amazing matcha powder base shines through taking away the guilt of the sweetly sinful, ummm sweetness!<br /><br />So again Red Leaf you delight me! Thank you for all your amazing matcha offerings and keep them coming!
2394	4	I purchased these coffee bags for use at work since we no longer receive free coffee from our compmany, and I don't want to deal with a coffee maker.  I don't drink coffee very often but when I want to, these coffee bags come in handy.
2395	5	I purchased the SF Bay "OneCup" without paying much attention to the use of the phrase "...for Keurig K-Cup Brewers," so I was surprised upon opening the first box of SF Bay OneCups. I didn't connect with the carefully chosen description which never called the product "K-Cups".  They probably would have liked to call them K-Pods, if it weren't for potential trademark issues.  Another reviewer remarked that they are a cross between K-Cups and pods.  I echo that.<br /><br />The pod units fit perfectly in our Cuisinart K-Cup, and are dimensionally similar, with the top being pretty much a K-Cup twin, and the pod material provides the filtration.  No post-brew drip issues either.  Since they aren't hermetically sealed, you will find a zip lock bag or other airtight container handy.  I'm guessing that the pod material is more biodegradable than a real K-Cup, and probably worth the trade-off, requiring more care to preserve freshness.<br /><br />If you are looking for a medium bold blend, try the SF Bay Rainforest Blend. Funky pod brews a nice 8 oz. cup.  I will be ordering again.
2396	1	I've never reviewed anything before, but have relied on reviews for many purchases.  If this keeps anyone else from buying this new soup thinking it is the same as the old one, then it's worth it.<br /><br />I've purchased and eaten the old version of the Dr. McDougall's Right Foods Chicken Ramen Big Cup Soup for several years.  When I suddenly couldn't get the 2.1 oz soup cups, and this appeared (1.8 oz soup cup), I bought 3 boxes of 6.  I ate the first one a few days ago, and barely could choke it down.<br /><br />The broth in no way resembles chicken broth, it's brown and watery and has a slight trace of miso or soy flavor, with a bitter after taste.<br /><br />YUCK!  Don't buy this, unless or until they re-formulate it again to once again be edible and resemble chicken soup.
2397	2	While I would not expect preserved truffles to have as strong a flavor as the fresh stuff, these were particularly weak, and even a whole truffle in a small omelette failed to register...
2398	5	I first experienced Douwe Egbert coffee when I lived in Brussels, and happily sipped it daily for several years. Imagine my dismay when returning to this country I found no equivalent that could spark my taste buds to the same degree no matter how many coffee vendors I tried.<br />At long last, I once again have a deeply satisfying, caffeinated nectar to sip as I gradually come to life each morning on my patio overlooking the lake. Thank you Philips and Douwe Egbert for adding immensely to the quality of my life and bringing Europe back to me, if only for a few minutes each day.<br />As a postscript, let me add that I think the Senseo coffee maker, for the price, is superb.
2399	3	I purchased the Peruvian coffee and it is only "okay." It has a smooth flavor but it is a bit weak and it definitely doesn't brew a `full-body' cup of coffee.  Also, the plastic cup and lid are a little stronger than all the other k-cups that I've tried and every time I put it in the coffeemaker I have to apply enough pressure that I worry that it might damage it.  So, I will still use the product that I have but I will certainly not be purchasing it again.
2400	5	My son loves his Happy Baby pouches, and I like to share them--they're like all organic smoothies!  Banana, beet, blueberry is a great flavor combination, too.
2401	5	These cocoa dusted almonds are really nice; since they are not covered in melted chocolate they are drier and nuttier with that dark cocoa topping, overall way better than candy. I find myself reaching for them a few times a day, after a while I really develop a taste for them.<br /><br />I like that these are slightly drier, it makes for a crispy snack versus the Marcona almonds which are chewier. I liked both though.
2402	5	This is wonderful honey.  Four pounds of Ambrosia honey arrived today  in square 16-ounce plastic bottles with tight seals.  ...no leaks of any kind.  Which is good because the honey arrived in the same box as our order for ocean fish canned catfood.  But  due to  excellent  packaging, all the flavors are wonderful, distinct and separate. (Our cats approved the catfood, we really welcomed the Ambrosia honey.)<br />Seriously, this honey is a natural and life-sustaining product, credit where credit is due. I tried some right after it arrived today; I had no joint pain after eating this honey, which means to me it is natural and doesn't contain  corn syrup or high fructose corn syrup, a chemical additive to some other brands of honey these days, they tell me.  I am grateful for no joint pain, no corn.  Pure honey.<br /> Other reviews  have told you about gentle handling of the product, and that any crystallizing (solidifying) is normal and reversible in a bath of warm water.<br /> So let me concentrate on what a terrific,  necessary product this honey is in your kitchen cupboard  and your emergency supplies.  Honey, peanut butter, and dry milk (or protein powder like MLO)  mixed together make a terrific emergency food.<br />Proportions are as follows:1/4 cup honey<br />  1/3 cup peanut butter<br />  1/2 cup dry milk or protein powder ,\\<br />Mix together into stiff dough that you can separate into bars or into 1-inch balls. (Many variations of this on recipe websites, if you want to look for them)<br /> Keeps in fridge, but during a power outage this mix will be so popular and useful, it won't need to be stored, just more of it made.<br />This is an old Adelle Davis nutritional recipe, credit where credit is due, and in addition this homemade food resembles to a degree a French-manufactured product called Plumpy'nut successfully used by UNICEF to help severely malnourished children.  (more about this on the Web, if you want to know more.)<br />Finally, for your emergency kit, a small amount of honey will help close a scrape or wound, and start it healing.  So many uses for this helpful product from the honeybees.  You can't lose but will win many times over with this Ambrosia natural honey.
2403	5	Got these decaf K-Cups for my boss and he enjoys the coffee very much. My sole driving factor was price. I figured even if the coffee wasn't so great it wouldn't be too bad because we didn't pay >$1 per K-Cup like the grocery stores want you to. We were pleasantly surprised to find this coffee delicious and the aroma that fills the office is refreshing. Kudos!
2404	3	If you are buying hemp oil, consider it for the health benefits and not the taste. Nutiva's Hemp Oil is descried as having a "nutty" taste. It does not taste nutty, but rather "earthy."<br /><br />Its about a 5/10 taste wise; not terrible, not great. I've tried using it as a replacement for olive oil, but the taste of the oil comes through too strongly.<br /><br />This product may be a good use to throw in for shakes or smoothies for its health benefits, but I do not consider this a viable replacement for traditional oils.<br /><br />EDIT: I've found mixing in hemp oil in shakes or making salad dressings is quite tasty.
2405	5	My niece was diagnosed with Celiac's and she was having a hard time finding a baking product she liked. She tried this one and loved it. So I set it up on the automatic shipments for her and she gets a gift from me every few months.
2406	5	I purchased 15 of these for my 7 year-old's birthday party.  The kids dressed in camouflage and we let them loose in the backyard.  They had a ton of fun!  Even the parents joined in.  I think the parents had more fun than the kids did.  We went through 20 pounds of potatoes!!!  We had a few guns break during the fun, but overall they were great.  At the inexpensive price, just buy a few extra.
2407	5	I decided to give ZOE brand olive oil a try since I was running out of my previous batch (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WHLZW8">Bertolli Classico</a>). I'm really glad that I did because it tastes excellent and is a better deal than the Bertolli. The first thing I noticed was its darker color (a true olive green, not nearly yellow like cheaper olive oils). I used some to prepare a pasta sauce, and was very impressed with the aroma when I fried the garlic, and even more impressed when I tasted the end result. I'm not an expert on olive oils by any means, but I generally know what I like and what I don't like, and ZOE really does deliver. This is a premium first cold press olive oil (the highest grade of olive oil) and it is very delicious!
2408	1	FYI to anyone who loves their cat(s) and is feeding them this premium cat food thinking it is... Well it was just (very quietly) bought out by P&G. Either that means something to you or it doesn't. For me it was a deal breaker. Our cat loved this food, but I won't feed him a product owned by that company. They *say* they will keep it all the same, but you never know.<br /><br />We switched to Orijen.
2409	2	My (indoor only) cats LOVE Fancy Feast Elegant Medley's but this flavor is the very last plate they eat from. For some reason they do not enjoy the Wild Salmon at all. I started feeding it to the "community cats" that wander up for breakfast and lunch and I have noticed that even they (being hungry and outdoors) don't scarf it up like like they do all of the other flavors. If you decide to give it chance make sure that your cats are real seafood lovers or try a few cans before buying it like a did; I bought 2 cases of each flavor (turkey, chicken etc...) so they are going to have eat it at some point.
2410	3	I love these, but sometimes the cheese doesn't mix in as easy as the less healthy versions. When it doesn't mix well, the cheese powder has kind of a funky, spicy flavor. Other than that, good product.
2411	1	I wrote to the Copper Moon Coffee Inc and got response. Basically, this proprietery blend is not Kona beans and is formulated to taste like it.

2412	5	Recently, I was gifted the Ice Cream of the Month Club by a very good friend. I was somewhat confused thinking "how the heck can their be an ice cream of the month club?" But, with having given and received numerous "of the month clubs" and having all great experiences in the past, I was curious to see what they had put together here. Needless to say, WHAT A FANTASTIC SURPRISE! The 4 boutique frozen deserts arrived packaged in dry ice and were completely frozen. My girlfriend and I were pretty enthusiastic to dive in and try them all, but took a step back to read the companies review on each of the vendors and brands. We decided that we would begin with the "Berto's Gelato - Roasted Banana True Italian Artisan Gelato." After a single bite, my girlfriend declared that it might be the best gelato she has ever had, and proceeded to eat most of it while we watched TV. The best description she give as she devoured the gelato was saying it was like having "velvet wrapping around your body." The additional flavors included in our shipment were Gilles Sherbet Swirl, Cedar Crest Elephant Tracks Ice Cream, and Oberweis Cookie Dough Classic. Each of the selections were very delicious and from companies I have never heard of. I highly recommend this club to any person looking to give or get an array of tasty desserts that you'll want to find more of once you're done!
2413	1	We ordered a large sampler of most of their products and some other items from this company's brochure. The cover says "Harvest Fresh taste". So we thought it was like fresh fruit. It wasn't, and, being middle aged, we could not chew it, it stuck in our teeth, and most was drenched in sugar. We tried it all. No one wanted to eat any of it. We were dissatisfied. They also did not send a free item their brochure promises for purchases above 79 dollars.<br /><br />No fear, the second page says "100% guarantee. All our products are unconditionally guaranteed. If you or your gift recipient are not satisfied, please contact us for an immediate replacement or refund. It's important to us that you are happy with your order."<br /><br />So I did and asked for a refund. So far, not on your life. So far they have had roadblocks and stalling, like requests for data on the bottoms of tins, when most items, and there are a lot, are in  small cellophane packages in a large sampler with no tins. A mess and a time consuming, aggravating horror to deal with.<br /><br />Unless you are addicted to candied type fruits, many heavily sugared and tough and hard to chew, and cannot do without, keep away from this firm or find what you like elsewhere. Especially if your teeth are not the youngest. These people do not honor their guarantees and are really no fun to deal with. I emailed many times and called. Both ways were unpleasant. I probably will have to contact my credit card for help.
2414	5	These licorice wheels are awesome! I love them, however, they may not be for everyone.  They dont have a traditional licorice taste, it is less dominant and more of a sweet flavor.<br /><br />They are a little "greasy" or "waxy" but I believe this is part of the preservatives.  These do not store or keep well for long periods of time, so make sure you buy them fresh, (they even have born on dates on the bags).<br /><br />I did not like these are first and thought they were weird, because they did not taste like every other licorice.  The taste grew on me and I like that you can eat them whole, bite off a piece, or unwind it into a long string. The green frogs and rainbow frogs are my favorite "traditional" gummi products but it is a tie overall.  Careful, they are addicting. :)
2415	1	I have worked for a major retailer for the past 20 years, we sell Soda Stream and all its accessories.  I even performed ALL the product samplings this past 4th quarter.  I bought one for myself.  I like it okay but slowly came to realize that every time I drank the diet cola my face would erupt with cysts that were huge and raw.  I thought it was stress or something else.  I went to an allergist and tested with very strong reaction to "sulfites".  everyone, I mean EVERYONE look at your bottles of syrup and despite all the "healthy" mumbo jumbo find the small print "contains sulfites".  My Dr. told me to stop drinking the soda stream diet cola (I believe all the flavors have sulfites, but I could be wrong) for several weeks.  I complied and stuck with good old Diet Coke.  My face cleared up within a few days and was cyst free.  Them my Dr. instructed me to make a batch of the diet cola in the 1 liter bottle and drink it throughout 1 day.  The next day the cysts were forming again and then progresively got worse.  Stopped using soda stream products completely and have had NO flair ups since.  I would be very careful as sulfites have many bad side effects.  I truly loved the product, its simplicity and sold tons of it because I thought it was great.  Little did I know I was selling something tainted with sulfites.  If you have noticed any strange blisters, cysts or acne do as I did with my Dr.s instructions and see for yourself.  I am male so don't insinuate it was a "monthly menstrual cycle".  BEWARE.
2416	1	This is the frst time I bought this biscuit for my 9.5 mo baby. The biscuit is hard n it broke off to smaller pieces inside her mouth but it didnt melt like those Gerber food. My baby's face then turned red.. She almost choked but luckily she swallowed it I guess but it scared me ..I wont but this again,
2417	1	I tried this tea as my introduction to Rooibos.  I was very excited after hearing of the benefits of rooibos.  To my dissapointment I thought this tea was disgusting!<br /><br /> Luckily, I didn't give up and tried other brands (Numi and Yogi are great) of rooibos and they were all fantastic.  This tea has a stale vanilla taste that completely covers up the natural flavor of rooibos.  Stay away from this tea.  Plain rooibos without added flavors is perfect on it's own.
2418	5	I LUV these! I ordered the assorted box, but the Classic Sea Salt are the best. I just ordered another box of the Classic (plain). If you are on the WW PointsPlus plan, these have 3 WW points. Huge bag, very filling. Great movie snack with a Coke Zero.
2419	4	I bought as a lightning deal because I needed a good snack at work.  These are delicious.
2420	5	Very quick delivery and same quality goods!  Cheaper than buying them at the actual pet store.  So, I'll be ordering again when I run out.  My dogs love them and their breath is a lot better.
2421	5	I am the mom of a 5 year old celiac, so it is very important to be able to make cut out sugar cookies and have them be decent. I have tried MANY gluten-free sugar cookie doughs. I have labored in the kitchen for hours mixing my own flours only to suddenly not have enough energy to actually bake something once I've finished.<br /><br />This mix is quite the blessing!! It makes a dough that is actually very easy to work with (not sticky at all like with other mixes). Mix it up, and don't even bother putting it in the fridge for hours! I roll it out between two pieces of parchment paper, make my cut outs (even the more detailed cutters work!), peel up the dough between the shapes, slide the piece of parchment paper onto a cookie sheet, and minutes later I now have the perfect cookies!! We roll ours out a little thick because we like them soft, and even then, the details of the cutter remain.<br /><br />And for the cookie artists out there, this mix works well with the cookie craft books, which I also highly recommend....<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1580176941">Cookie Craft: From Baking to Luster Dust, Designs and Techniques for Creative Cookie Occasions</a>
2422	4	My son likes this flavor, he eats them for a snack now. This is a good blend of fruit, veggies, and grain.
2423	3	I thought the Tyson brand would taste better than it does. I tried to drain as much of the liquid as I could but the mix was still soggy. I added the mayonnaise and relish plus some spicy mustard. It's okay when there are no other options. Sometime I travel on cargo aircraft and there is no galley to even get hot water for packaged soup. I can carry a kit whereever I go and I don't have to worry about refrigeration. The crackers are whole grain and taste good. Next time I'll try adding some chicken spices or Louisiana style hot sauce, not tabasco sauce, to see if it perks up. The little plastic container is nice and reusable. Find a set of small spoons or knives to mix instead of the spatula enclosed in the kit, useless.
2424	5	These noodles are good.  They smell a little fishy when you<br />first open the package, but then you rinse and cook them for a couple<br />minutes and they smell fine after that.
2425	5	This is a great tea for many reasons. Lipton tea always reliable and each packet includes tea granules, milk and sugar all in one packet. I find the flavor quite good and the ease of use when travelling makes this a perfect cup of tea. All you do is add hot water. This product is not widely found and I feel very lucky to have found it online at Amazon.com My teenage children really like this tea as well. I believe because of the ease of use. I am thrilled to be able to purchase this product online.
2426	5	Finally, dried pineapple that is not fluorescent yellow and covered in sugar. Kopali's dried pineapple is amazingly fresh, tasty, and plain - no sugar or anything else added. I found it to be a perfect snack for on the go, very delicious and feel good as well!! Plus they have a great mission. Hope you all love it as much as I do!
2427	1	Was shopping for some crackers to use as snacks with my diet.  Saw the "Saturated Fat Free" rather than the "fat free" printing on the front of the box.  Checked the ingredients.  This contains Partially Hydrogenated Soybean Oil.  Makes me not trust Ry-Krisp.
2428	5	I was reluctant to purchase Xanthan Gum, thinking it was too expensive, and frankly, it was a foreign ingredient that I had never used before.  To my absolute delight, I found Xanthan Gum to be an indispensible ingredient in gluten free baking!  It is easy to use, and will last a long time in your pantry.  As any Celiac's patient (or person with gluten sensitivity) will tell you, it's wonderful to bake a Gluten free birthday cake from scratch, with the confidence that everyone will want to eat it!
2429	5	This is great coconut oil. I now use this oil exclusively for all of my cooking needs. It has a nice mild flavor that enhances everything I cook. I am very happy with this product and will continue to purchase it.
2430	5	Expensive, but there is a good reason, it's taste is beyond wonderful. Wish I had never taseted it :) !
2431	5	I saw these treats online and was going to order them but I went to my local grocery store and they had them there for a 1.00 cheaper. I brought these home and my cocker spaniel puppy has been going crazy for them ever since. He gobbles them up. He even starts to cry and whine when I open the bag because he wants it so bad. I'm glad its a healthy option for him. He loves the pumpkin/banana ones better then the pumpkin/apple. I haven't tried the others because I know that cockers can be sensitive to allergys. I also saw the chewy ones at the store as well so I will try those and update my review.
2432	5	love this tea, and it is a great amount for the money.<br />makes a nice pot of tea to enjoy.
2433	2	Though I am normally a fan of Newman's Own products, these cookies were terrible. Twice the thickness of other gingersnaps and very small (around 1 1/2 " in diameter), they have little or no ginger flavor. This alone would have discouraged me, but the bag I received was also burned. They weren't simply very browned; there were burned spots around the edges, and the bottoms were blackened. The first (and only) one I ate filled my mouth with a strong burned taste that lingered. I checked the rest of the cookies, but all seemed to be burned. Hopefully, this is a quality control issue that can be resolved, but I will not be trying them again.
2434	1	This is a difficult review to write.  I have reflux and coffee is a major trigger.  I LOVE good coffee, dark, strong, robust coffee.<br /><br />I was so happy to find this product and had hoped I could "have my coffee and drink it, too."  It is not to be.  I would rather have nothing than drink this.<br /><br />Coffee is such a personal thing.  I know most people drink it because they are addicted to caffeine (otherwise there would be NO on buying the majority of the coffee sold in grocery stores).  I drink coffee because I absolutely love the taste (I normally drink decaf everything so caffeine is not a factor for me).<br /><br />For those who absolutely cannot have coffee and aren't particular about flavor, I think this product will be a godsend.  Just like the gluten free products are godsends for celiacs, but you won't catch me eating them either!
2435	5	Great coffee from a familiar maker, this kona blend really rocks and the price is unbeatable anywhere!
2436	5	These treats are my picky cat's favorite.  I've tried about 8 different brands in the past and these are always the preferred kind.  Highly recommended!
2437	5	Please don't waste your time taking the typical grocery-store brands like Heinz - you know, the vinegars that you would normally clean with.  When those types of vinegars are processed, they lose many of the health benefits that taking a swig or two of a good organic vinegar provides.  Taking a dose of a GOOD apple cider vinegar daily such as this brand will help get rid of the toxins as well as help fight certain illnesses.<br /><br />This Braggs Organic Apple Cider Vinegar tastes the best and it contains the MOTHER.  I use this on fried red cabbage, and daily on my salad I eat for lunch.<br /><br />Sometimes I even take a tablespoon straight out of the bottle.  I always make sure I have a drink handy when I do this, because sometimes it feels like it's going to take your breath away.
2438	2	I love the brown sugar cubes but when I ordered this item listed I didn't notice that it was for the WHITE cubes. The photo shown on the order was the brown box - this would only have brown cubes! I didn't attempt to return it because I read that Amazon doesn't accept food items returned and of course, I would have to pay the return postage.
2439	4	BOTTOM LINE:<br />GLUTEN FREE!  This stuff was sooo good, I really wish I had another bowl right now. The Quantity:Price ratio takes the product down one star.<br /><br />FLAVOR:<br />I thought the flavor was excellent, in that I could really taste the garlic, pepper, and onions.  The broth was a little salty at first, but I added a bit more water to get it to where I wanted.  I also thought it could use a little spiciness, but I feel that way about everything (I left out their oil packet and added a squirt of my own Hot Chili Sesame Oil - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0005ZXXWM">House of Tsang Hot Chili Sesame Oil</a> and it was perfect).  It was really nice in that it had more than just your standard chicken/ msg broth flavor - it had real subtle flavor notes.<br /><br />NOODLES:<br />GLUTEN FREE!  I thought I would note that I really like the noodles in this - they are not your standard Ramen noodle, but are a form of rice noodle, similar to Vietnamese Pho.  These take a little longer to cook, but are definitely a great match for the broth.  I bought them because they are gluten free, but they make a great soup noodle in their own right.<br /><br />QUANTITY vs. PRICE:<br />I wish there was more in the bowl than what was provided.  This is what takes the product from 5 stars down to 4.  For the price, I wish there was more food - or for the amount of food, I wish it was cheaper.  To be fair, I bought this at my supermarket, and not on here, but the price is similar.
2440	5	I got this sauce for a Christmas present.I was not expecting it to be as good as it was.Although i thought it was a bit mild the taste made up for the lack of burn.This versatile sauce has great depth of flavor and I highly recommend it.I polished off the whole bottle in two days.That says it all!
2441	5	I first bought Coconut oil at the health food store and spent ten bucks for a 16 ounce container. Once I realized the flexibility and benefits of coconut oil, I wanted a better price. This is it. Though this price varies (I've spent in the range 35-45 dollars for 128 ounces on Amazon which amounts to a significant drop in cost to what I paid locally.)the price is right.<br /><br />I've had one container that had hard, tiny beads of coconut oil, but it still did what it was supposed to do, though they were a little more resistant to melting. Otherwise, in the three batches we've purchased, this is the only minor complaint.<br /><br />I use it to replace shortening, or to fry, and it's perfect for baking. The coconut flavor is there, but it's subtle. If you hate the flavor of coconut you might want to think twice. I thought I did, but the more I started thinking along the lines of embracing coconut I realized the texture of shredded coconut was what I had issues with. Coconut oil makes delicious stove popped popcorn that doesn't need butter for more flavor ...it ends up with kind of a sweet/buttery taste. Cookies, brownies, etc are delicious with coconut oil replacing butter or margarine.<br /><br />This product is also my only moisturizer and lotion of choice. We scoop some out of the main container (into a recycled hummus jar, short, with a wide mouth) and store it in the bathroom. This past winter, before I started using coconut oil as a moisturizer/lotion, my skin was painfully dry. I drink lots of water, and I was using different products, but my skin was not happy. Seriously, Coconut oil is the best. It soaks in quickly, though not immediately, and it really took care of the itchy dry. I was a little more concerned about my face. But my skin was so dry I felt like smiling would crack my face, so I dove in and tried it. Perfect. Again, it doesn't soak in immediately. I put it on, get dressed, do my hair, then apply my makeup. My foundation brush has sucked up some of the oil so I'll need to replace those maybe sooner than I would otherwise. But for a facial moisturizer that works as well as anything I've ever tried and costs about $.35 an ounce...I think I can live with that. I also haven't had any clogging of pores and I'm an aging T-Zone skin.
2442	5	My elderly dog (15 year old beagle) can't see much any more, or hear much, but she still really enjoys her food.  Zoe usually turns her nose up at anything other than her regular food, but not this time.  She dived in and did't stop until it was gone.  Not wanting to change completely, we mixed it with her life long food - Science Diet.  She picked out the Chef Michael's pieces and at them first.  It's softer than regular dry and I think she liked that, and it smell good, even to me.<br />There is a variety of shapes and we saved the bigger chunks to give her as a treat.  That's how much she loves this food.  My picky eater picked  Chef Michaels!  And at 15, she get anything she wants.
2443	5	I'd never tried these before, but I keep reading about how good cacao is for you. So I tried them and they are so good. I can eat them right out of the bag. I've also ground them up in my coffee grinder for use in a shake. I will be using them for just about everything now, especially baking. Can't wait!!
2444	4	This will be short one, as most of Kristian Reg&aacute;le stuff is (delightfully!) similar.<br /><br />After finding a hidden cache of Kristian Reg&aacute;le we've been pounding through them, and I actually went back get another set!<br /><br />My wife made "My Dream Greek Pasta" (which was quite yummy) when we decided to try this. The color is similar to a light apple juice or some of the more translucent Chardonnays we've tried, with small bubbles just slowly trickling up. I noted both pear and apple on the nose.<br /><br />My first impression was positive. The pear taste is not as strong as the RW Knudsen's sparkling pear, and the carbonation is on par with the other Kristian Reg&aacute;le drinks I've tried, though it's a bit more mild than the Pomegranate, and much more mild than the Lingonberry. It's light bodied and the citrus acid gives it just a tiny acidic kick. Comparing only the taste, and not the carbonation, it's terribly dissimilar from Martinelli's.<br /><br />The mild, yet pleasant taste makes this easy to pair with. It'd go with many, many different foods, though especially with cold, light foods, like salads, pitas and hummus, or cheeses.<br /><br />Did I Like it: Yes, 7 out of 10. It will be a regular (or table drink) in our house now.
2445	4	This gourmet coffee has an exceptional strong taste with a hint of the exotic floral and berry flavor. The aroma itself enticed me. I have never tried yiragcheffe coffee before, but if it is anything like this one, I will certainly have it again.
2446	5	I have tried many different black teas over the years. I've been drinking this kind for a few years now and it's by far my favorite. Strong, but not too bitter.
2447	5	My dog loves this food and he's lost a few pounds since he's been on it.
2448	4	Good coffee and its a fair trade product so you can feel extra great inhaling the scent and complex yet simple flavors yet knowing you've helped the earth and the people on it a bit in your small way. Each drop of rain causes a ripple in a lake. One step at a time if we each do one thing like even falling for this easy to use organic coffee that will softly delight your tastebuds without overpowering them.
2449	4	When I went on a totally crazy elimination diet to sort out some food allergies, I started looking for foods that I had never eaten before (that I definitely wasn't allergic to) to round out my menu.  I got the sardine idea from Dr. Mark Hyman, who touted them as a healthy addition to any diet.  I was sooooo scared to eat these things that I let the first sample box (from the health food store) sit in my cupboard for over a month before I worked up the courage to try a bite.  I actually think I started with the regular old sardines in olive oil.  The more bites I took, the more I liked them. Then I got brave and bought a box of these (with mustard) from the store.  Wow, even better.  They tasted so good, I went ahead and ordered the 12-pack on amazon.  I have also tried the other mustard sardines by crown prince (not sure what the difference is) and they are not as good.  Since my crazy diet ended (well..I'm still gluten-free, dairy-free, egg-free..slightly crazy!) I've had these things on toast (gluten free) with tomatoes - mmmm..., with rice, and in a salad.  Very good.  I find the mustard to sardine ratio to be perfect most of the time, though some boxes seem to have slightly too much mustard.  While I was pregnant (had a baby 2 months ago) I did not want to even look at a box of these, but I plan on getting back to sardine-ville again soon.
2450	4	I purchased this product as an add in for my oatmeal. the flax and pumpkin seeds add flavor and texture to my steel cut oatmeal.the added crunch is a plus.
2451	5	I never used white flour much prior to becoming gluten free but there are some recipes that simply don't turn out as well with any other type of flour. One of those is dutch babies which turns out light and fluffy made with this flour blend:<br />4 EGGS, 1 cup MILK, 1 cup MAMA'S FLOUR BLEND with 1/2 tsp XANTHAN GUM (always add xanthan when using a GF flour). Add ingredients one by one (in order) to a blender until blended well then pour slowly into the middle of a 10-12 inch iron skillet pre-heated in 425 oven until 1/4-1/2 cube BUTTER is (just) melted in it then swirled to cover sides. Bake for 18-20 minutes and serve immediately. Good with sauteed apples and cinnamon topped with sour cream or yogurt with a sprinkle of brown sugar or (my favorite and the easiest) LEMON WEDGES squeezed over with a sprinkle of POWERED SUGAR.
2452	5	Its a little grainy but not very. I do constantly mix it as i drink in between drinking periods. Its my first day drinking it so i dont know the benefits or energy i should feel, i do feel tired after drinking it the past 2 times, but it could be my new sleep cycle lol i put a scoop in a cup and add juice. So far the juice i added to it was 'mango peach, pineapple' drink. I think it goes better with peach or mango flavors alone a well. So far its been a great buy.<br /><br />I dont know what people are complaining about! It tastes like a green machine smoothie drink from the Naked brand drinks..when i mixed it with the juice i mentioned lol<br /><br />I'll keep you posted!
2453	2	This is not great coffee I was very disappointed. It does not have a nice coffee flavor it is smooth and not bitter, but no flavor.
2454	2	Product is good, but you save about 15% (assuming no sales tax) just buying it in your local grocery store.
2455	5	This is an awesome product.  It is very gentle, but it tingles so you know it's working.  It has a really nice smell.
2456	5	I have a corn allergy and Bob's Red Mill is the only brand that I could find that didn't use some form of corn in their dates to prevent clumping.<br /><br />Taste wise, they are great! Not dry at all, slightly chewy but nice and tender. After using an entire bag I did not run across even one pit or piece of pit! And the slight bit of oat flour doesn't distort the taste or texture.<br /><br />I just love having a 1/4 cup of these as a snack and they hit the spot!<br /><br />Bob's Red Mill dates are by far one of the best, if not the best that you can readily get since most stores carry them. No additional sugar (some add sugar to dates, crazy hu?), no preservatives, and main thing for me, no corn products!
2457	1	I've been cycling my cats through a few different kinds of wet food, based mostly on convenience, and they devour them all. I ended up buying my cats some avoderm dry food, and they had no objection, so i was a little surprised when i plunked down a can of this wet food and they refused to eat it. After staring at it and glaring at me for a while, they finally deigned to lick the gravy off, but left the meat bits there until i cleaned them up.<br /><br />Honestly, i almost gave this a five-star review, because i've been wanting to wean my cats off the wet food for a while, but they love it so much. Since i started offering them this, they've stopped even asking for wet food anymore.
2458	5	After reading the book "The food pets die for" and finding out that Science Diet & Iams actually use road kill and cancerous animals in their dog food, which turns around and adds the risk of your dog getting cancer or other horrible diseases I started him on an all organic diet, including his treats. After a lot of research this is the food I decided to feed my 10 lb toy poodle and he loves it!!
2459	5	I drank this hot in the winter, but have recently tried brewing and chilling it.  It's great cold too!  Much better than the bottled green tea available .... even the Lipton bottled green tea. Just poor the brewed tea into used water bottles and chill.
2460	5	Granted, this coffee is not Starbucks.  Then again, if that's what you're expecting then you won't be happy.  However, this coffee is a great everyday coffee that tastes better than your standard Folgers or Maxwell House but provides a better value.  For the amount of coffee you get (64 oz), it's a better deal than anything I can buy at Sams Club.  The grind is a little more coarse than other ground drip coffees (like Folgers or Maxwell House), and could probably work in a french press if you don't mind a little extra sediment in your coffee.  I was pleasantly surprised at the mellow taste that wasn't weak and have been enjoying this coffee for about a week straight.  I would definitely recommend this coffee to anyone who isn't expecting their coffee to taste like a kick in the face--which by the way, I do love Starbucks in addition to more mellow brews.
2461	5	great cocoa. good when you want to drink on a cold evening and dont need the fat and sugar on your gut. the only kind of cocoa my wife will drink. drank this on Christmas eve and loved every minute of it
2462	2	Did not smell as fresh as I had hoped.  My cat was uninterested.  Trader Joe's has organic catnip that comes with a scratcher for $6.99 which smells much more potent.  Maybe try a different brand?
2463	5	Great Product I personally do not like to drink large cans of energy drinks, so when I started taking these 5 hour energy shots It was exactly what I was looking for. Great Price and product.
2464	4	<span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:32 Mins<br /><br /></span>One reviewer smartly pointed out that the water source that this company uses is "municipal water." That's tap water. Before you think negatively of that, consider that they then put it through the reverse osmosis process and add the ingredients that I mention in the video.<br /><br />More importantly, since it's bottled in Bothell, Washington, you can be assured that their municipal water is outstanding - practically spring water.<br /><br />The fact that it tastes just like nice water isn't surprising. It would be worrisome if it didn't taste like water!
2465	5	I buy greenies for  my two best friends.  My vet commented on how their teeth are looking good because of the greenies.  My ten year old Scottish terrier and my four year old Standard Poodle will dance circles for their greenis..lol.  How cool is that?
2466	5	Update to my original review:  I found out their xanthan gum is grown on corn, although they state that processing removes all of the corn from the xanthan gum.  We found this out the hard way...my son had a reaction after eating this product 3 times.  He is VERY sensitive to corn so other corn allergics may tolerate it without issue.  Original review revised: This is the best gluten/wheat/egg and almost corn free muffin mix I have found (it's free of a lot of other things but these are the allergies we have to worry with).  I use ground flaxseed in place of the eggs and follow the directions on the box to make banana muffins and they turn out perfect every time.  Don't skimp if you're out of unsalted butter, go get the exact ingredients or they won't rise as nicely...trust me, it's worth the trip.  Everything I've tried from 123 Gluten Free has been 5 star.  They maintain excellent allergen standards and taste better than anything else I've tried.  Follow the baking directions to a T and you won't be disappointed.
2467	3	This is supposed to be a nut milk bag and it is. That said, it is on the smallish side and if you have big nuts to milk it won't be large enough to accommodate the load. Too bad the seller didn't bother to tell you the volume is around  a quart and not more.
2468	5	Good salt.  Check your local supermarket for a better price.  Safeway is selling this same 3 lb. box of Diamond Crystal Kosher salt for $4.99.
2469	5	Complete, protein-based nutrition.  My dogs love this...although I'm not sure the pibble actually tastes it, she inhales it so fast.  ;)<br /><br />Regarding the other users who have had diarrhea issues:  My gastro-picky GSD (is that a word? I think other GSD owners will understand!) has had this as well.  Initially, I overfed this food, thinking that he needed to be eating the same amount as he had been eating the other stuff.<br />You feed MUCH less of this product.  It is nutrient-dense, and not all filler like other foods.  If you over-feed, you increase the risk of unpleasant side effects.<br /><br />It's a bit pricey, and I haven't broken down the cost per day, but since you feed less it might be competitive with other brands if someone was inclined to "run the numbers".
2470	2	I like many of the CS teas, but this one is bland to my taste.
2471	5	My cats love these treats and they're good for the cats' oral health as well.
2472	5	I am very pleased with the order. The only thing I would change is the amount of time your customers can order your products. This product is 3 months or 6 months before ordering again. I think we should be able to order when we need the item. Three months is too soon and six months is way too much time in between. Other than that the flavor and cost is great. Thank you.
2473	4	I really enjoy tea and drink two or three 16 ounce cups a day, especially when it's cold outside. I used to drink mostly Twinings and Bigelow because hey, that's what they had at the supermarket. But I tried Stash a few years ago and have slowly switched to drinking it almost exclusively. They make wonderful flavours and have very reasonable prices. I particularly appreciate being able to buy 100 sealed bags at a time from Amazon, because that really lowers the price. And as long as you can set aside the minimal storage space, it isn't as though sealed tea bags go bad!<br /><br />Chai Spice Black is my preferred morning tea blend. It has more caffeine and more flavour than the other teas I drink later in the day. It's tasty and smells good, and the tea is consistent from bag to bag (to bag to bag to bag! I've been drinking this stuff for a few years now. :)
2474	5	I bought this so I could share the joy of fruit stripe gum with my kids!  It was a flavor I remember as a kid.  Consistency is a wonderful thing.
2475	1	I have an otherwise healthy and active 1 year old Rottweiler.  I switched her from Blue Buffalo to Canidae, as it came highly recommended by the holistic pet store I frequent (they are going to be the next to get an earful from me!!!).<br /><br />Shortly after, I noticed her stool became loose, which is common when you change a dog's diet (I mixed the new food with the old for a week, gradually increasing the amount of the new).  I figured it would get better after a few days.  In fact, it became increasingly worse to the point where spots of blood where showing up in her stool.<br /><br />I took her to the vet thinking at this point she must have picked up a parasite.  The test came back negative.  My vet thought it must have been something she ate and recommended I feed her chicken and rice for a week to even her out.  I did this and the problem was solved.<br /><br />After a week I put her back on her regular food- Canidae- and the problem she was having before began to return, albeit gradually.  We have now started to see spots of blood again.  This convinced me it was not just "something she picked up," but the dog food itself.<br /><br />Now I have learned there is actually a CLASS ACTION SUIT against this dog food maker for the exact problem I described- in some cases people's dogs even died.  I will NEVER purchase this brand again and am switching my dog immediately back to Blue Buffalo- this time no mixing!!
2476	5	I have to say, I don't think I've ever had a bottled water that tastes as light as this water from Essentia does. Right from the outset, you'll notice it and I don't think it has anything to do with any sort of chemical process to get it that way but I'd put my money on it having to do with some sort of filtration method that makes this water taste the way it does. And that's not to say it tastes much different from regular water, the difference lays mainly in the consistency of it. I was surprised by the overall quality of it and I definitely like it enough to recommend it.
2477	5	The air is full of hickory smoke when you open the jar. You need very little to add a great smoky hickory flavor. Can't wait to try the other flavors.
2478	4	When it comes to a body wash, I want something that's going to leave me clean and smelling better than I did when I took a shower.  But I don't want it to be so overpowering that other people flee the room when I enter.  I also want something that's on the masculine side of things and isn't overly floral.<br /><br />Enter the Dove Care for Men series.  I figured I'd give it a try and see how it works.<br /><br />So far, it's pretty good.  I swim laps a couple of times a week in a heavily chlorinated indoor pool.  So my first expectation is that the body wash would help remove that feeling of dryness and general chlorine-ness that can sometimes occur.  And it did that.<br /><br />The good thing is the dispenser on the top is large enough to get out enough but not so big that you're getting a ton more of the body wash then you need.  It allows for a greater degree of control and to use as little or as much as you need.  (I tend to err on the side of starting out with too little and getting more as needed rather than having too much).<br /><br />As for the scent, it's fairly subdued and not overpowering.<br /><br />A nice combination.
2479	4	These do help to keep my dogs teeth clean and they are just the right size for my 7 lb chihuahua. Much, much better value on Amazon then your local pet supply warehouse.
2480	3	It's a bit hard to rate something as bland as rice vermicelli, but here goes.  It had to be soaked before cooking, but cooked up nicely.  It has little inherent taste of its own, but works nicely with any number of other ingredients, providing nice variety.  Would we go out looking for this or buy a case at a time?  Not really.  But if we found it locally, we might buy a bag to have on hand from time to time - just not worth the price as a main food product.  It is not something we'd likely use a lot of the time.  As the title says, it's a moderately good product, just not great.  Another reviewer hit it badly for no taste - I would not have expected a substantial taste, just more of a different variety of additional food product that goes with whatever else is mixed in with it.  It will take on the flavor of whatever it's cooked with - it is NOT a stand-alone food.<br /><br />One note: it isn't worth the money.  At Amazon's price, this is selling for more than $5.00/pound yet it's not even a pure brown rice product, as one might think from the packaging.  Fortunately, due to dietary restrictions I've got, I read labels.  Read the label on this one.  It's got SOME brown rice in it....
2481	4	I do like the Lime taste. It's pretty strong, and very unique. However, at no point in time did I feel like I was eating "Lime and Chili" almonds. There was absolutely no kick from the chili.<br /><br />Very tasty still, but not what I was hoping for.
2482	4	Hot and sour soup takes a long time to make from scratch. This is a great product for mking a much quicker and easier version. I add cooked ground pork, tofu, soy sauce, black vinegar, and whatever else I think of at the time. Its always very good.  Other online stores sell it for about $26 for 6.
2483	5	I make it overnight in the slow cooker. 2 cups oatmeal (always steel cut!), about a cup of dried fruit, a little salt (1/2 teaspoon or so), and 8 cups of water. I start it at bedtime and it's ready in the morning. I freeze it in 1 cup bowls and have oatmeal for a week.
2484	5	We have been unable to find ReeseSticks in our local markets, we ordered from Amazon received prompt delivery and have been enjoying the ReeseSticks since<br />we received them. Still have not located in local stores will have to reorder soon.
2485	5	For years, my early-teen son and I have enjoyed these <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4IRA">Nature Valley Crunchy Granola Bars</a> in the Maple Brown Sugar flavor, so we were pleased to find them for sale here. They've been a favorite for both of us for years... we call them our crunchy oatmeal, as the main ingredient is whole grain rolled oats.<br /><br />Each pack in the box has two slim bars that total 180 calories and total carbs of 29g, so they've not only been a decent candy bar alternative, but a good snack while cycling or walking. The crunchy bars are not too sweet, have a nice maple brown sugar flavor, and are well wrapped and sealed for carrying in all types of weather.<br /><br />Another variety that we enjoy are the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EMQFY4">Nature Valley Chewy Trail Mix Bars</a> in the Fruit & Nut flavor. These are nicely chewy, with a nice oat flavor, and can be gentler on the mouth the crunchier varieties. If you're counting carbs and calories, these are listed as having total carbohydrates of 25g and 140 calories. For our purposes, they're ideal for our frequent cycling activities.<br /><br />Either type of these granola bars is just filling enough to satisfy mild food cravings, and they're decent between meal snacks for kids or fairly active adults. Some say that teenagers and adults rarely concur on many things, but in our agreed opinion, these are a pretty even match in overall enjoyment. In our case, we usually get both.<br /><br />But crunchy or chewy, either is a good snack choice.
2486	5	I never realized anything this tiny could be this wonderful!  From the first taste of Dark Chocolate to the wonderful refreshing taste of pomagranate -- simply divine!
2487	5	Green tea can be very bitter especially if you brew it too long. This tea brews quickly and has a very pure taste and delicate aroma. I like drinking each cup with a packet of stevia. It seems to sweeten it just enough without masking the subtle silky flavors. This tea is made of rare white tea and green tea. White tea actually has more antioxidants than green tea and has less caffeine. So this particluar tea is very healthy. However you will probably drink it often because it tastes so good.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
2488	2	These nuts are a decent snack on their own and I've made cookies with them as well. They are slightly sweet and I don't think the Splenda taste is overwhelming or unpleasant, but that is obviously a personal preference. Bought them on sale at Target for $3 a package, or about half the current listed price here.
2489	3	This flavor is all right... original beef flavor is still the best one for me. Def wont buy this flavor agn. shipment came on time.
2490	5	After struggling with pain due to gallstones, I did some research about diet changes, and among the suggestions were:<br /><br />1 - Find alternative means of protein where possible because of the fat & cholesterol in meat & poultry.<br />2 - Increase fiber intake.<br />3 - Replace refined and "enriched" carbohydrates with wheat or whole grain where possible.<br />4 - Incorporate flaxseed into diet.<br /><br />This cereal did all of those things for me, and on top of all that - it's delicious!  I've tried other Kashi brand cereals, but this is by far my favorite.  I agree with other reviewers who compared it to Smacks... (in my mind, it's like Smacks mixed with Honey Bunches of Oats with Almonds).<br /><br />A recommendation for anyone who finds it too "dense", or thinks it's too expensive to buy regularly... I usually make myself a mixed bowl of this with Honey Nut Cheerios (half and half of each).  The combination works great, in my opinion!  :-)
2491	5	I sent this to my son for a snack during finals week.  It didn't arrive as scheduled, so he didn't have it for finals week.  He was finally able to pick it up today as the mail room on campus was closed for winter break.  It was a nice surprise and he had plenty to share with his friends, thank goodness it didn't spoil.  I would order this item again, but I would request a different means of delivery.
2492	5	......BUT, same great taste!  These Kays Naturals Better Balance Protein Parmesan Chips are different though. I have these on Subscribe and Save and the entire old pkge equalled 1.5servings, 165Cals, about 5.2gFat, 16.5 Net Carbs, 15gProtein, 4.5gFiber.<br />  But, this has been changed with the current NEW packaging:<br />NOW<br />  1serving= 1whole bag!<br />And, NOW an ENTIRE bag has<br />120Cals<br />11(Net)Carbs<br />12gProtein<br />2.5gFat<br />4gFiber<br /><br />So, that's probably good news for those of you who didn't want to divvy (sorry, no time to check if this is a valid word per the dictionary) a bag up into 1.5servings and try to compute the nutritional facts for the whole bag.<br />  But, ahhh, a little less protein and that's one of the main factors in purchasing these.  But, still, no complaints:  Overall, a great move!
2493	5	It is very good tuna, the package is hillllarrious! No Tuna in nature is as white as that photo on package perhaps maybe the rare, ever so elusive, albino tuna. If you have purchased Tuna in a pouch before then you know that this in reality, looks like beige colored canned tuna smashed flat. But it forks up into chunks or more like flakes.<br /><br /> It has virtually no water added but is not too dry, has a very mild taste, and is very convenient in the 1 serving pouch. It has 80 calories and is a decent source of Omega-3 EPA and DHA with 190mg of those combined in each serving, not a whole lot, but very good.  I would buy again but only on sale as it's really only worth a buck twenty five each for these 2.5 ounce servings.
2494	3	Good  but they only sent 19 k-cups in the box.  The mix was supposed to be at least 8 different ciders and 8 different cocoas. I only recieved 5 different ciders and the rest was cocoa.  Good quality product but lousy  counting.
2495	5	Nice.<br /><br />I bought this to add into my hair routine. And so far so good! I combine it with pure organic cold pressed olive oil- my hair loves it.<br /><br />The quality and texture are great.<br />I like the containers- they're plastic jars which makes storing them a breeze.<br /><br />I also use this on my skin sometimes, and it works GREAT.  It really saturates into the skin- makes it very smooth and extremely soft. I actually use the olive oil/coconut oil combo on my skin, so I guess its both products at work... but either way it goes it'll leave you with softer skin.<br /><br />It's a little messy for me because I have to transfer it into a smaller bottle, but I just started using the top of a straw/sippy cup as a funnel and that helps. The smell is strong, if you like coconut you'll love this. I'm not that huge on it, so at times its a bit much for me.<br /><br />This is the best deal on on this product you'll find- 2 for $16 (and free shipping if you spend $25)... but I still wish it was more like 2 for $10.
2496	5	Wasabi!  Almonds!  What's not to love?  Can't stop eating these, glad they come in packs of six...
2497	2	When I ordered Poppycock in Jan. it was great.  In April it had far less coating and about one third the nuts as before.  I believe this product has been taken over by Conagra and it is a shame that it still says "original" on the package.  I will not order it again.
2498	4	What a great tasty morning or anytime treat.  I don't have sugar in my cereals and this one is just perfect.  Filling, Fabulous and Fiber!!!
2499	5	they are verry verry good and fresh  works good for snacks for handdecapped person who is all so a shut end  goes well with black coffee
